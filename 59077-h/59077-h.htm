<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In your voyage down the west coast of Africa,
after passing the southern extremity of Morocco,
you sail for days and nights together past the
shores of a never-ending land of desolation. It is
the Sahara, “the great sea without water,” to which
the Moors have given also the name of “Bled-el-Ateuch,”
the land of thirst.</p>

<p>These desert shores stretch for five hundred leagues
without one port of call for the passing vessel, without
one blade of grass, one sign of life.</p>

<p>Solitude succeeds solitude with mournful monotony;
shifting sandhills, vague horizons—and the
heat grows each day more intense.</p>

<p>At last there comes in sight over the sands an old
city, white, with yellow palm trees set here and
there—it is St Louis on the Senegal, the capital of
Senegambia.</p>

<p>A church, a mosque, a tower, houses built in
Moorish style—the whole seems asleep under the
burning sun, like those Portuguese towns, St Paul
and St Philip of Benguela, that once flourished on
the banks of the Congo.</p>

<p>As one draws nearer one sees with surprise that this
town is not built on the shore, that it has not even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
port, nor any direct means of communication with
the outer world. The flat, unbroken coast line is as
inhospitable as that of the Sahara, and a ridge of
breakers forever prevents the approach of ships.</p>

<p>Another feature, not visible from a distance, now
presents itself in the vast human ant heaps on the
shore, thousands and thousands of thatched huts,
lilliputian dwellings with pointed roofs, and teeming
with a grotesque population of negroes. These are
the two large Yolof towns, Guet n’dar and
N’dar-toute, which lie between St Louis and the sea.</p>

<p>If your ship lies to awhile off this country, long
pirogues with pointed bows like fish-heads, and bodies
shaped like sharks, are soon seen approaching. They
are manned by negroes, who row standing. These
pirogue men are tall and lean, of Herculean proportions,
admirable build and muscular development,
and their faces are those of gorillas. They have
capsized ten times at least while crossing the breakers.
With negro perseverance, with the agility and
strength of acrobats, ten times in succession have
they righted their pirogue and made a fresh start.
Sweat and sea water trickle from their bare skins,
which gleam like polished ebony.</p>

<p>Here they are in spite of all, smiling with an air
of triumph, and displaying their magnificent white
teeth. Their costume consists of an amulet and a
bead necklet, their cargo of a carefully sealed leaden
box, which contains the mails.</p>

<p>In this box also are orders from the governor for
the newly arrived ship, and in it, too, are deposited
papers addressed to members of the colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>A man in a hurry can safely entrust himself to
these boatmen, secure in the knowledge that he will
be fished out of the sea as often as necessary with the
utmost care, and that eventually he will be deposited
on the beach.</p>

<p>But it is more comfortable to continue one’s voyage
as far south as the mouth of the Senegal, where flat-bottomed
boats take off the passengers and convey
them smoothly by river to St Louis.</p>

<p>This isolation from the sea is one of the chief
causes of the stagnation and dreariness of this
country. St Louis cannot serve as a port of call to
mail-steamers or merchantmen on their way to the
southern hemisphere. One goes to St Louis if one
must, and this gives one the feeling of being a
prisoner cut off from the rest of the world.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the northern quarter of St Louis, near the
mosque, there stood a little solitary house belonging
to one Samba-Hamet, trader on the upper river. It
was a lime-washed house. The cracks of its brick
walls, the crevices in its heat-shrunken wood-work
harboured legions of white ants and blue lizards.
Two marabout cranes haunted its roof, clacking
their beaks in the sunshine, and solemnly stretching
out their featherless necks when anyone chanced to
pass along the straight, unfrequented street.</p>

<p>O the dreariness of this land of Africa!</p>

<p>The slight shadow of a frail thorn palm moved in
its slow daily course along the whole length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
heated wall; the palm was the only tree in the
quarter, where no green thing refreshed the eye. On
its yellowed fronds flights of those tiny blue or pink
birds, called in France <i>bengalis</i>, would often come
and perch. But all around lay sand, sand, nothing
but sand. Never a tuft of moss, never a fresh blade
of grass grew on the soil, parched by the burning
breath of the Sahara.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>On the ground floor dwelt a horrible old negress
called Coura n’diaye, once the favourite of a great
negro monarch. There she had her collection of
grotesque tatters, her little slave girls, decked with
beads of blue glass, her goats, her big-horned sheep,
her half-starved, yellow curs.</p>

<p>In the upper storey there was a large, lofty room,
square in shape, to which an outside staircase of
worm-eaten wood gave access.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Every evening at sunset, a man in a red jacket,
with a Mussulman fez on his head—in a word, a
spahi—entered Samba-Hamet’s house. Coura n’diaye’s
two marabout cranes used to watch him
from a distance as he approached. From the
farther end of the dead-alive town they would recognise
his gait, his step, the striking colours of his
uniform, and would show no nervousness at his entry—so
long had they known him.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, of proud, erect carriage; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of pure European race, although the African sun had
already deeply embrowned his face and chest. This
spahi was a remarkably fine-looking man, a grave and
manly type of beauty, with large clear eyes, almond-shaped
like an Arab’s. From under his fez, which
was pushed to the back of his head, a lock of brown
hair had escaped and hung in disorder over his broad,
unsullied brow.</p>

<p>The red jacket was admirably becoming to his
well-moulded figure, and his whole build was a compound
of litheness and muscular strength.</p>

<p>As a rule he was serious and thoughtful, but his
smile had a seductive charm, and gave a glimpse of
teeth of remarkable whiteness.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>One evening, the man in the red jacket could be
seen climbing Samba-Hamet’s wooden staircase
with more than his customary air of abstraction.</p>

<p>He entered the lofty chamber, his own, and seemed
surprised at finding no one in it.</p>

<p>It was a curious place, this lodging of the spahi’s.
It was a bare room, furnished with mat-covered
benches. Strips of parchment, written upon by the
priests of Maghreb, and talismans of various kinds
hung from the ceiling.</p>

<p>He went to a large casket, raised on feet, ornamented
with strips of copper and variegated with
brilliant colours, a box such as is used by the Yolofs
for locking up their valuables. He tried it and found
it locked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon he lay down on a <i>tara</i>, a kind of sofa
made of light laths, the work of negroes of the
Gambia shore. Then he took from his pocket a
letter, and began to read it, first kissing the corner
with the signature.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was without doubt a love-letter, written by
some fair one—an elegant Parisienne, perhaps, or
possibly a romantic senora—to this handsome spahi
<i>d’Afrique</i>, who seems of the very mould for playing
leading rôles as the lover in melodrama.</p>

<p>This letter will perchance furnish us with the clue
to some highly dramatic adventure, which will serve
as prelude to our tale.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The letter, which the spahi had touched with his
lips, bore the postmark of a village hidden away in
the Cevennes. It was written by a poor old hand,
trembling and unpractised. Its lines overlapped,
and it was not free from mistakes.</p>

<p>The letter said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My dear son,—The present is to give you news of our
health, which is pretty good just now; we thank the good
God for it. But your father says he feels himself growing
old, and as his eyes are failing a good deal, it is your old
mother who is taking up the pen to talk to you about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
ourselves. You will forgive me, knowing that I cannot
write any better.</p>

<p>My dear son, I have to tell you that we have been in
great trouble for some time. Since you left us three years
ago, nothing has gone well with us. Good fortune, as
well as happiness, left us when you did. It has been a
bad year on account of a heavy hailstorm which fell on
the field and destroyed nearly everything except at the
side of the road. Our cow went sick, and it cost us a lot
of money to have her attended to. Your father’s wages
are sometimes short, since he came back to this country
of young men, who work faster than he. Besides this
we have had to have part of our roof repaired, as it
threatened to fall in with the heavy rains. I know that
soldiers haven’t much to spare, but your father says that
if you can send us what you promised without stinting
yourself, it will be very useful to us.</p>

<p>The Mérys, who have plenty of money, could easily
lend us some, but we don’t like asking them, especially as
we do not want them to think us poor people. We often
see your cousin, Jeanne Méry; she grows prettier every
day. Her chief joy is to come and see us, and to talk
about you. She says she would ask nothing better than
to be your wife, my dear Jean. But her father will not
hear of the marriage, because he says we are poor, and
also that you have been a bit of a scapegrace in your
day. I think, however, that if you were to get your
quartermaster’s stripes, and if we could see you coming
home in your fine uniform, he would perhaps end by
consenting after all. I could die happy if I saw you
married to her. You would build a house near ours,
which would no longer be fine enough for you. We
often make plans about it together with Peyral in the
evenings.</p>

<p>My dear son, send us a little money without fail, for
I assure you that we are in great trouble. We have not
been able to manage this year, as I told you, because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that hailstorm and the cow. I see your father worrying
himself terribly, and at night I often see him, instead of
sleeping, thinking about it and turning from side to side.
If you cannot send us the whole amount, send what you
can.</p>

<p>Good-bye, my dear son; the village folk often ask after
you, and want to know when you are coming back. The
neighbours send hearty greetings. As for me, you know
that I have had no joy in life since you went away.</p>

<p>I enclose my letter, embracing you, and Peyral does
likewise.</p>

<p class="center">Your loving old mother,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Françoise Peyral</span>.</p>

</div>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>... Jean leaning on his elbow at the window fell
into a reverie, looking absently at the wide prospect
of African scenery stretched out before him—the
pointed outlines of the Yolof huts, grouped by
hundreds at his feet—in the distance the troubled sea
and the ceaseless onset of the African breakers; the
yellow sun about to set, still shedding upon the
desert, further than the eye could see, its wan
radiance; sand interminable; a distant caravan of
Moors; flights of birds of prey swooping through the
air; and yonder, a point on which he fixed his eyes,
the cemetery of Sorr, whither he had already escorted
some of his comrades, mountain-bred like himself,
who had died of fever in that accursed climate.</p>

<p>O to return home to his aged parents, to live in a
little house with Jeanne Méry, quite close to the
humble paternal roof. Why had he been exiled to
this land of Africa? What had he in common with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
this country? As for this uniform and this Arab fez
in which they had dressed him up, and which, for all
that, gave him so grand an air, what a burlesque
disguise for him, the humble little peasant from the
Cevennes.</p>

<p>He remained there a long time lost in thought,
dreaming of his village, this poor soldier on the banks
of the Senegal. With sunset and nightfall, his
thoughts plunged themselves in unrelieved gloom.</p>

<p>From the direction of N’dar-toute came the hurried
drumming of the tom-tom, summoning the negroes
to the <i>bamboula</i>, and fires were lighted in the Yolof
huts. It was an evening in December; a vexatious
winter wind sprang up, whirling the sand in eddies
here and there, and the great, parched land
shuddered with an unwonted sensation of chill.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>The door opened, and a yellow dog with straight
ears and a look suggesting the jackal, a dog of the
country, of the Laobé breed, bounded into the room
and gambolled about his master.</p>

<p>At the same time, a young negro girl, with a merry
smile, appeared at the door of the lodging. She
made a little jerky bow, brusque and comic, the
negresses’ salutation, and said <i>Kéou</i>! (Good-day).</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The spahi glanced at her absently.</p>

<p>“Fatou-gaye,” he said in a mixture of creole
French and Yolof, “open the casket; I want to take
out my money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your <i>khâliss</i>!” (your coins), exclaimed Fatou-gaye,
opening her eyes so that the whites showed
against the black eyelids. “Your <i>khâliss</i>!” she
repeated with the mixture of fear and effrontery of
children who have been surprised in a fault and are
afraid they will be punished.</p>

<p>And then she showed him her ears, on which hung
three pairs of exquisitely worked gold earrings.</p>

<p>They were ornaments of pure Galam gold, wonderfully
delicate, such as are made by black craftsmen
who possess the secret of this art, plying their trade
in the shade of small, low-roofed tents, where they
work mysteriously, crouching on the desert sands.
Fatou-gaye had just been buying these trinkets, long-coveted,
and that was what had become of the spahi’s
<i>khâliss</i>, a hundred francs or so, accumulated little by
little, the fruit of a soldier’s petty economies, and
set aside by him for his old parents.</p>

<p>The spahi’s eyes flashed, and he made as if to strike
her with his whip, but his arm sank harmlessly to his
side. He soon regained his self-control, Jean
Peyral; he was gentle, especially towards the weak.</p>

<p>He uttered no reproaches, knowing that they
would be useless. It was his fault no less than hers.
Why had he not been more careful to hide away this
money, which he must now at all costs procure elsewhere?</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye knew how to soothe her lover with catlike
caresses; how to clasp him in her black silver-braceletted
arms that were shapely as the arms of a
statue; how to lean her bare bosom against the red
cloth of his jacket, rousing in him feverish desires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that would bring about pardon for her offence....</p>

<p>And the spahi sank with indifference on the tara
beside her, putting off until the morrow the task of
raising the money for which his old parents were
waiting in their cottage overseas.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was three years since Jean Peyral had first set
foot in this land of Africa, and since his arrival he
had undergone an extraordinary transformation.
He had passed through several phases of moral
development. Environment, climate, nature, had
gradually exercised all their enervating influence upon
his youthful personality. Slowly he had felt himself
gliding down unknown slopes—and to-day he was the
lover of Fatou-gaye, a young negro girl of Khassonké
race, who had cast upon him I know not what
sensual and impure seduction, what talismanic enchantment.</p>

<p>The story of Jean’s early life was not a very
complicated one.</p>

<p>At twenty the ballot had snatched him from his
old mother, who wept. He had gone away like other
lads of the village singing noisily to keep himself from
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>His height marked him out for cavalry. The
mysterious attraction of the unknown had induced
him to choose the corps of spahis.</p>

<p>His childhood had been passed in the Cevennes, in
an obscure village in the heart of the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>In the strong, pure mountain air he had shot up
like a young oak tree.</p>

<p>The first impressions graven on his childish mind
were wholesome and simple, the well-beloved forms
of his father and mother, his home, a little old-fashioned
house shaded by chestnut trees. These
things were all imprinted ineffaceably upon his
memory, and had their own sacred place deep down
in his heart. And then there were the great woods,
his wanderings at random along paths deep in moss—and
there was freedom.</p>

<p>In the first years of his life he knew nothing of the
rest of the world beyond the bounds of the obscure
village where he was born. He was aware of no
other neighbourhood, but the wild, open country
where the shepherds dwelt, the mountain sorcerers.</p>

<p>In these woods, where he was wont to roam all
day long, he nursed the dreams of a solitary child, the
musings of a shepherd boy—and then suddenly he
would be seized with a wild desire to run, to climb, to
break branches from the trees, to catch birds.</p>

<p>One distasteful memory was that of the village
school, a gloomy place, where one had to stay quietly
cooped up within four walls. His parents gave up
sending him there; he was always playing truant.</p>

<p>On Sunday he was given his fine mountaineer’s
dress to wear, and he went to church with his mother,
hand in hand with little Jeanne, whom they picked
up as they passed Uncle Méry’s house. After service,
he used to play bowls on the common under the
oak trees.</p>

<p>He was conscious that he was better looking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
stronger than the other children, and at play he was
always the one to be obeyed, and he was accustomed
to meet with this submission wherever he went.</p>

<p>When he grew older his independence of spirit and
his insatiable restlessness became more marked. He
would go his own way. He was forever in mischief,
untethering horses and galloping far away on them,
forever poaching with an old gun that would not go
off, and frequently getting into trouble with the rural
constable, to the great despair of his Uncle Méry,
who had hoped to have him taught a trade, and to
make of him a steady man.</p>

<p>It was true. He had really been “a bit of a
scapegrace in his time,” and it was still remembered
against him at home.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was a general favourite even
with those who had suffered most at his hands,
because he had a frank and open disposition. No
one could be seriously angry with him who saw his
good-natured smile. Besides, if he were spoken to
gently and taken the right way, he could be led like
a docile child. Uncle Méry, with his lectures and
threats, had no influence over him. But when his
mother reproved him, and he knew that he had
grieved her, his heart was very heavy, and this big
boy, who had already the air of a man, could be seen
hanging his head, almost in tears.</p>

<p>He was undisciplined, but not dissolute. This big,
strong, growing youth was of a proud, and somewhat
uncouth, demeanour. In his village young men
were safe from evil communications from the precocious
depravity of sickly, town-bred creatures, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
much so, that when he reached his twentieth year
and had to begin his term of military service, Jean
was as pure as a child, and almost as ignorant of the
facts of life.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>But then came a period full of all kinds of surprises
for him.</p>

<p>He had followed his new comrades to places of
debauch, where he had made the acquaintance of
“love” in the most sordid and revolting conditions
that a great town affords. His youthful understanding
was confused, what between surprise and disgust,
and also the devouring fascination of this new thing
just revealed to him.</p>

<p>And then, after some days of riotous life, a ship
had carried him far, far away over the calm, blue sea,
and had landed him on the banks of the Senegal, a
bewildered exile.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>One day in November—the season when the great
baobabs shed their last leaves on the sand—Jean
Peyral had cast his first glance of curiosity on this
corner of the earth, where the hazard of destiny had
condemned him to pass five years of his life.</p>

<p>The strangeness of this land had in the first instance
appealed strongly to his imagination and inexperience.
Besides that, he had appreciated very keenly
the joy of having a horse, of curling his rapidly
growing moustache, of wearing an Arab fez, a red
jacket, and a big sabre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
He considered the ensemble very fine, and this
gave him great pleasure.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was November—the fine weather season corresponding
to our French winter; the heat was less
violent, and the dry wind of the desert had taken
the place of the great storms of the summer.</p>

<p>When the fine weather begins in Senegal, one may
safely camp out in the open without a roof to one’s
tent. For six months not a drop of water will fall
on the land; every day without respite, without
remorse, it will be scorched by the consuming sun.</p>

<p>It is the season in which the lizards delight—but
the water fails in the cisterns; the marshes dry up;
the grass dies; even the cactuses, the thorny nopals,
no longer open their melancholy yellow flowers. Yet
the evenings are chill. At sunset a strong sea-breeze
invariably springs up, rousing the breakers off the
African coast to their everlasting moaning, pitilessly
shaking the last autumn leaves.</p>

<p>It is a dreary autumn, bringing with it neither the
long evenings of France, nor the charm of the first
frosts, nor harvest, nor golden fruit. Never a fruit
in this land disinherited of God! Even the dates of
the desert are denied to it, nothing ripens there,
except the ground nut and the bitter pistachio.</p>

<p>The sensation of winter, experienced in the midst
of heat which is still extreme, has a curious effect
upon the spirit.</p>

<p>Here and there upon the vast, hot plains, forlorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and desolate, covered with dead grass, side by side
with slender palms, tower huge baobabs, mastodons,
as it were, of the vegetable kingdom; their bare
boughs are inhabited by families of vultures, lizards,
and bats.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Poor Jean had soon fallen a victim to boredom.
He suffered from a kind of vague, indefinable
melancholy, such as he had never felt before, the
beginning of home-sickness for his mountains,
his village, for the cottage of the aged parents,
so dear to him.</p>

<p>The spahis, his new companions, had already worn
their big sabres in various Indian and Algerian
garrisons. In the taverns of maritime towns, where
they had spent their youth, they had caught the
mocking and licentious turn of mind, peculiar to
those who lead a roving life. They were masters of
ready-made, cynical jests, in slang, in Sabir, and in
Arabic, and with these jests they met every contingency.
Good fellows at heart, gay companions as
they were, they had none the less certain habits which
Jean failed to understand, and certain pleasures that
excited in him extreme repugnance.</p>

<p>Jean was a dreamer, like all mountaineers.
Reverie is a thing unknown to the stupefied and
corrupt faculties of the populace of great cities. But
among those who have been brought up on the land,
among sailors, among fishermen’s sons who have
grown up in their father’s boat, amid the perils of
the deep, there are men who really dream, true, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
inarticulate poets, with a poet’s insight into all
things. Only, they have not the faculty of putting
their impression into form, and remain incapable of
interpreting them.</p>

<p>Jean had plenty of leisure in barracks, and he spent
it in observing and thinking.</p>

<p>Every evening he was wont to take a walk along
the great stretch of beach, whose bluish sands were
lighted up by sunsets of unimaginable beauty.</p>

<p>He would bathe in those great breakers of the
African sea, amusing himself, like the child he still
was, by letting himself be rolled over and over by these
enormous waves, which covered him with sand.</p>

<p>Or he would take long walks, for the mere
pleasure of movement, of breathing deeply the salt
air that blew off the sea. At times this unending
flatness vexed him, oppressed his imagination, accustomed
to the contemplation of mountains. He felt,
as it were, a need to go on and on forever, to widen
his horizon, to catch a glimpse of what lay beyond.</p>

<p>At dusk, the beach was crowded with negroes
returning to the villages, laden with sheaves of millet.
Fishermen, too, were drawing in their nets, surrounded
by clamorous swarms of women and
children.</p>

<p>These hauls of fish in Senegal were always
miraculous draughts; the nets would break under the
weight of thousands of fish of every shape and form.
The negresses carried away on their heads baskets
full of them; the black babies returned home
garlanded with big fish, still alive, strung together
through the gills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>There were extraordinary-looking people, just-arrived
from the interior; picturesque caravans of
Moors and Peuhles, who had come down the Neck
of Barbary; incredible scenes at every step, in the
white glow of an unnatural radiance.</p>

<p>And then the blue summits of the sandhills turned
pink; the last horizontal rays of light glided across
this whole region of sand; the sun was quenched in
blood-red vapour. And with one impulse all that
black throng cast themselves face downwards on the
ground to offer up the evening prayer.</p>

<p>It was Islam’s holy hour. From Mecca to the
Sahara coast the name of Mahomet passed from
mouth to mouth, wafted like a mysterious breath over
Africa. Little by little it became fainter as it
travelled over the Soudan, until it expired there on
those black lips by the shore of the great, restless
sea.</p>

<p>The old Yolof priests in their flowing robes,
turned towards the sea, recited their prayers with
their faces bowed upon the sand, and all the shores
were covered with prostrate men. Then all was still,
and night fell with the rapidity usual in those
countries of the sun.</p>

<p>At nightfall, Jean returned to the spahi’s quarters
in the south of St Louis.</p>

<p>In the great white barrack room, open to the
evening breeze, all was still and quiet. The numbered
beds of the spahis were ranged in rows along the
bare walls; the tepid wind from the sea swayed their
muslin mosquito curtains. The spahis were out.
Jean returned home at a time when the other men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
were scattered about the deserted streets, hastening
to their pleasures, to their loves.</p>

<p>It was at such times that the isolated barracks
seemed to him dreary, and that he thought most of
his mother.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In the southern quarter of St Louis stood some
old brick houses, Arab in appearance, which were
lighted up at evening, and whose lamps continued to
cast their red rays upon the sands at a time when all
that dead-alive town lay asleep. Strange odours of
negroes and alcohol, all blended and intensified by the
torrid heat, issued thence. Here also at night broke
forth an uproar as from hell itself. In that quarter
the spahis reigned supreme. Thither betook themselves
these unfortunate, red-jacketed warriors, to
raise a racket and to forget their troubles; to absorb,
actuated either by habit or bravado, incredible
quantities of alcohol, and wantonly to spend the sap
of their lusty youth.</p>

<p>A dishonouring intimacy with mulatto women lay
in wait for them in these vile dens, and extravagant
orgies were held, in a delirium caused by absinthe
and the torrid heat of Africa.</p>

<p>But Jean avoided with horror these haunts of vice.
He was very steady, and was already putting aside
the little he could save out of his soldier’s pay,
against the blissful moment of his home-coming.</p>

<p>He was very steady, and yet his comrades did not
rally him on the subject.</p>

<p>Handsome Muller, a tall Alsatian, who set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tone in the spahis’ barracks by virtue of a past full
of duels and adventure—handsome Muller thought a
great deal of him, and every one was always of the
same opinion as Fritz Muller. But Jean’s real
friend was Nyaor-fall, the black spahi, a gigantic
African, of the magnificent Fouta-Diallonké tribe,
a strange, imperturbable figure, with a delicate
Arab profile, and a mysterious smile always
hovering on his thin lips—a splendid statue in
black marble.</p>

<p>This man was Jean’s friend; he used to take Jean
home to his native dwelling in Guet n’dar; he would
make him sit beside his wives on a white mat, and
offer him negro hospitality: <i>kouss-kouss</i> and <i>gourous</i>.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In the evenings at St Louis, social life followed
the usual monotonous routine of small colonial towns.
The fine weather brought a little animation to these
dead-alive streets. After sunset, a few women who
had escaped fever displayed their European frocks
on the Place du Gouvernement, or in the avenue of
yellow plains of Guet n’dar. This introduced a
suggestion of Europe into that country of exile.</p>

<p>On that large Place du Gouvernement, surrounded
by symmetrical, white buildings, one might have
imagined oneself in some town of southern Europe
had it not been for that immense stretch of sand, that
interminable plain, which flung afar its uncompromising
line.</p>

<p>These few persons who came to take the air were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
all acquaintances, and passed the time in staring at
one another. Jean would look at these people, and
they also would look at Jean. The handsome spahi,
who walked alone with such a grave seriousness,
roused the curiosity of St Louis society, who
imagined that his life contained some romantic
episode.</p>

<p>There was one woman, in especial, who looked at
Jean, a woman better dressed and prettier than the
rest.</p>

<p>She was said to be a mulatto, but so white, so
very white, that she might have been taken for a
Parisienne.</p>

<p>White and pale she was, of a Spanish pallor, with
fair chestnut hair—the fairness of mulattos—with
large, half-closed, dark-shadowed eyes, which she
turned slowly with creole languor.</p>

<p>She was the wife of a rich farmer of revenue on
the river. But at St Louis she was referred to by
her Christian name, like a coloured woman. Cora
they called her, in contempt.</p>

<p>She had just returned from Paris, as the other
women could see from her gowns. Jean, however,
was not yet sufficiently experienced to be able to
define the difference. But he was well aware that
her trailing gowns, even when they were simple, had
something distinctive about them, a gracefulness, in
which the other women’s gowns were lacking.</p>

<p>The point that he principally noticed was that she
was very beautiful, and as she always flung her
glances around him, he felt a sort of tremor when
he met her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s in love with you, Peyral,” handsome
Muller had declared, with the knowing air of a man
who has had his successes in the pursuit of love
affairs.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>It was true that she was in love with him in her
mulatto way, and one day she summoned him to her
house to tell him so.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>For poor Jean the two months that followed fled
past in the midst of enchanting dreams. This unwonted
luxury, this dainty, perfumed woman, all
these things worked terrible confusion in his hot head
and chaste body. Love, of which hitherto only a
cynical travesty had been revealed to him, now
intoxicated him.</p>

<p>And all this had been bestowed upon him precipitately,
without reservation, like a splendid
fortune in a fairy tale. Yet one reflection
troubled him. This woman’s avowal, this want
of modesty, disgusted him a little when he
thought about it.</p>

<p>But he seldom pondered, and when he was at her
side he was intoxicated with love.</p>

<p>He, too, began to experiment with refinements of
the toilet. He used scent, and tended his moustache
and his brown hair. It seemed to him, as to all
young lovers, that life had begun for him on the day
when he first met his mistress, and that all his past
existence counted for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Cora loved him, too, but the heart had little to do
with the sort of love she felt.</p>

<p>A mulatto of Bourbon, she had been brought up
in the sensual idleness and luxury of wealthy creoles,
but had been kept at arm’s length by white women
with pitiless contempt, repulsed everywhere as a
coloured woman. The same racial prejudice had
pursued her to St Louis; although she was the wife of
one of the leading farmers of revenue on the river,
she was left alone, an outcast.</p>

<p>In Paris she had had numbers of exquisites to love
her; her ample means had enabled her to make a
presentable appearance in France, to taste vice
according to the most elegant standards of propriety.</p>

<p>At present she was tired of delicate gloved hands,
the sickly affectations of dandies, and their romantic
languid airs. She had chosen Jean because he was
big and strong. In her way she loved this splendid,
wild growing plant. She loved his rough, simple
manners; she found attraction even in the coarse
texture of his soldier’s shirt.</p>

<p>Cora’s dwelling was an immense brick building,
with the somewhat Egyptian aspect common to the
old parts of St Louis, and white like an Arab
caravanserai. Below, there were great courts,
whither came camels and Moors of the desert to
crouch upon the sand, and where swarmed a
grotesque, motley crowd of cattle, dogs, ostriches,
and black slaves.</p>

<p>Up above there were endless verandahs, supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
by massive, square columns, like the terraces of
Babylon.</p>

<p>The apartments were reached by means of outside
staircases of white stone, monumental of aspect. All
this was dilapidated and dreary, like everything else
at St Louis, that town which has already lived its
life, that moribund colony of bygone days.</p>

<p>The drawing-room had a certain air of grandeur,
with its lordly proportions and its furniture of the
past century.</p>

<p>Blue lizards haunted it; cats, parrots, tame gazelles
chased one another over the fine Guinea mats; negro
women servants went dolefully backwards and forwards
across the room, shuffling their sandals,
diffusing pungent odours of soumaré and musk-scented
amulets. The ensemble produced an indefinably
melancholy atmosphere of exile and solitude.
It was very dreary, all of it, especially in the evening,
when the sounds of life ceased and gave place to the
eternal complaint of the African breakers.</p>

<p>In Cora’s bedroom everything was gayer and more
modern. The furniture and hangings, lately arrived
from Paris, gave it an air of fresh elegance and comfort.
One breathed there the perfume of the most
fashionable essences bought at the scent shops on the
boulevard.</p>

<p>It was there that Jean passed his hours of intoxication.
This room seemed to him an enchanted
palace, surpassing in luxury and charm all that his
imagination could have pictured.</p>

<p>This woman had filled his life and had become his
only happiness. With the refinement of a creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sated with pleasure, she had desired to possess Jean’s
soul as well as body. With the feline guile of a creole
she had acted for the benefit of this lover, who was
younger than herself, an irresistible comedy of
ingenuous love. She had succeeded; he belonged to
her, body and soul.</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>A very comical little negress, of whom Jean took
no notice, lived in Cora’s house as a “captive.”
This little girl was called Fatou-gaye.</p>

<p>She had been brought quite recently to St Louis
and sold as a slave by Douaïch Moors, who had
captured her in one of their raids upon the territory
of the Khassonkés.</p>

<p>Her extreme mischievousness and her fierce independence
had caused her to be relegated to a very
humble position in the household. She was looked
upon as a little nuisance, a useless mouth, and an
acquisition to be regretted.</p>

<p>Having not yet quite arrived at marriageable age,
when the negresses of St Louis deem it proper to
clothe themselves, she generally went naked, with a
necklet of <i>grigris</i> round her throat, and a few glass
beads strung round her loins. Her head was very
carefully shaven, except for five tiny locks of hair,
knotted and stiffened with gum, five little rigid tails,
arranged at regular intervals from the forehead to
the nape of the neck. Each of these locks had a
coral bead at the tip, except the middle one, which
displayed a more precious ornament. This was a
gold sequin of great antiquity, which must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
brought in old days from Algiers by caravan, after
long and complicated wanderings through the
Sahara.</p>

<p>Without this grotesque arrangement of hair, the
regularity of Fatou-gaye’s features would have been
striking. She was of the purest Khassonké type:
a small delicate Grecian face, with a skin smooth
and black as polished onyx; teeth of dazzlingly whiteness;
eyes of extraordinary mobility, two large, jet
black, restless orbs rolling left and right, with whites
of a bluish tint, and black eyelids.</p>

<p>When Jean was leaving his mistress, he often used
to meet this little creature.</p>

<p>As soon as she saw him she tucked a piece of blue
cotton cloth around her waist—this was her festal
garment—and came towards him smiling. With
soft, caressing inflections in her small, shrill, piping
negress’s voice, with hanging head and the mincing
airs of an enamoured ouistiti, she would say,</p>

<p><i>May man coper, souma toubab.</i> (Translated:
Give me a copper, give me a sou, my white man.)</p>

<p>That was the refrain of all the little girls in St
Louis. Jean was used to it. When he was in a
good temper and had a sou in his pocket, he would
give it to Fatou-gaye.</p>

<p>But that was not the most curious feature of the
incident. What was out of the ordinary was Fatou-gaye’s
behaviour. Instead of buying herself a piece
of sugar, as other girls might have done, she would go
and hide herself in a corner and set to work to sew
very carefully into the sachets of her amulets the
sous that she received from the spahi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>One night in February a suspicion crossed Jean’s
mind.</p>

<p>Cora had asked him to leave at midnight, and just
as he was going away, he thought he heard a sound
of pacing in an adjoining room, as if someone were
waiting there.</p>

<p>He left at midnight, and then he returned with
stealthy tread, stepping noiselessly over the sand.
He climbed over a wall and on to a balcony, and
looked into Cora’s room through the half-opened door
leading on to the terrace.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Someone had taken Jean’s place by his mistress’s
side—quite a young man, wearing the uniform of a
naval officer. He had made himself at home, and
was lounging in an arm chair with an air of disdainful
ease.</p>

<p>She was standing, and they were talking.</p>

<p>At first it seemed to Jean that they were speaking
an unknown tongue. The words were French, yet
Jean could not understand them. These scraps of
speech, which they interchanged so lightly, seemed to
him mocking enigmas, perfectly meaningless for
him. Cora too, was no longer the same; her expression
had changed; a kind of smile hovered on her
lips, a smile such as he remembered to have seen on
the lips of a tall girl in a place of ill-repute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Jean found himself trembling. He felt as if all
the blood had left his head, and had poured back into
his heart. He heard a roaring in his ears, like the
noise of the sea; his eyes grew dim.</p>

<p>He was ashamed of being there, yet he was determined
to remain and to understand.</p>

<p>He heard his name spoken; they were talking
about him; he drew nearer, supporting himself
against the wall, and he caught some words more
distinctly spoken.</p>

<p>“You are wrong, Cora,” said the young man in
a very quiet voice, with an exasperating smile. “In
the first place, he is a very handsome fellow, and then
he, at all events, loves you.”</p>

<p>“True, but I wanted two of you. I chose you
because your name is Jean, like his. Otherwise I
should have been capable of making a slip in the
name when I was talking to him. I am very
absent-minded.”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>And then she drew closer to the new Jean.</p>

<p>She was still more changed in voice and face.
With the languorous, lisping, coaxing inflections of
the creole accent she murmured childish words to
him, and offered him her lips, still warm from the
spahi’s kisses.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>But her lover had caught sight of the pale face of
Jean Peyral gazing at them through the half-open
door, and for all reply he pointed Cora towards him
with his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The spahi was standing there, motionless, petrified,
fixing his wide, haggard eyes upon them.</p>

<p>When he found that they in their turn were looking
at him, he simply stepped back into the shadow.
Cora had advanced towards him, with the hideous
expression of an animal disturbed in its love-making;
this woman frightened him; she was almost near
enough to touch him. She shut her door with a
furious gesture; shot a bolt behind it ... and all
was over.</p>

<p>Through the disguise of the polished <i>élégante</i> the
mulatto woman, grand-daughter of a slave, had
betrayed herself again with her appalling cynicism.
She felt neither remorse, nor fear, nor pity....</p>

<p>The coloured woman and her lover heard a noise
as of a body falling heavily to the ground, a loud
sinister noise in the silence of the night—and then
later, towards morning, a sob behind that door, and
a rustling sound as of hands fumbling in the dark.</p>

<p>The spahi had risen to his feet, and feeling his
way, he went out into the night.</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Walking on aimlessly, like a drunken man, sinking
ankle-deep in the sand of the deserted streets,
Jean came to Guet n’dar, the negro town with its
thousands of pointed huts. In the darkness he
stumbled over men and women who lay sleeping on
the ground rolled in pieces of white cotton, seeming
to him like a population of phantoms. He walked
on and on, feeling as if he had lost his senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon he found himself on the shore of the sombre
sea. The breakers were roaring loudly. With a
shudder of horror he distinguished swarms of crabs,
fleeing before his footsteps, in solid masses. He
remembered to have seen a corpse that had been
washed up on the beach, torn and excarnated by
them. He had no wish for such a death.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these breakers attracted him; he felt
himself fascinated, as it were, by those great, glistening
volutes, already gleaming silvery in the doubtful
light of the morning, curling over all along the vast
beaches, farther than the sight could reach.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that their coolness would be
grateful to his burning head, and that in their kindly
waters death would appear less cruel.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>And then he remembered his mother and Jeanne,
the little friend and sweetheart of his childhood. He
no longer wished for death.</p>

<p>He threw himself on the sand and fell into a
strange, heavy sleep.</p>

<p>For full two hours it had been daylight, and Jean’s
sleep continued.</p>

<p>He was dreaming of his childhood and of the woods
of the Cevennes. It was dark in these woods, dark
with the mysterious obscurity of dreamland; his
visions were clouded like far-off memories. He
saw himself there, a child, with his mother in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
shade of immemorial oaks: in a spot carpeted with
moss and slender grasses he was plucking bluebells
and heather.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>And when he awoke, he cast a bewildered glance
around him.</p>

<p>The sands were glittering under a torrid sun.
Black women, adorned with necklets and amulets,
were traversing the burning ground, singing weird
melodies. Great vultures glided backwards and forwards
silently through the still air; the grasshopper
chirped noisily....</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Then he noticed that his head was sheltered under
a little canopy formed by a piece of blue cotton,
supported by a series of small sticks planted in the
sand, the whole erection casting upon him a clear-cut,
ashen shadow with grotesque contours....</p>

<p>The patterns of the piece of cotton seemed to him
familiar. He turned his head and saw Fatou-gaye
seated behind him, rolling her mobile eyeballs.</p>

<p>She it was who had followed him and had spread
her festal garment above his head.</p>

<p>Had it not been for this shelter he would undoubtedly
have died of sunstroke sleeping on those
sands.</p>

<p>She it was who for several hours had been crouching
there in ecstasy, very gently kissing Jean’s eyelids
when no one was passing, dreading to wake him lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
she should send him away, and no longer have him
all to herself; trembling, too, at times lest Jean
should be dead, yet happy, perchance, had it been so.
For then she would have dragged him far away, very
far away, and would have stayed with him always
until she died by his side, clasping him tight, so that
none should separate them again.</p>

<p>“It is I, my white man,” she said, “I did this,
because I know that the sun of St Louis is not good
for the <i>toubabs</i> of France.... I knew very well,”
continued the little creature with tragic solemnity,
in an indescribable jargon, “that there was another
<i>toubab</i> who came to see her. I did not go to bed
last night so that I might listen. I was hidden on
the staircase among the calebashes. When you
fell down by the door, I saw you. I watched over
you the whole time. And then when you got up, I
followed you.”</p>

<p>Jean gazed up at her, his eyes wide with astonishment,
and full of kindness and gratitude. He was
touched to the heart.</p>

<p>“Do not tell anyone, child.... Go home now
quickly, and do not tell anyone that I came and lay
down on the beach. Go back to your mistress at
once, little Fatou. And I, I will go back to the
spahi’s house.”</p>

<p>And he caressed her, patting her gently with his
hand, with precisely the same emotion as he felt when
he used to scratch the neck of the big, coaxing Tom
cat, who at night in barracks would come and curl
himself up on Jean’s soldier’s cot.</p>

<p>Quivering under Jean’s innocent caress, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hanging head, half-closed eyes, and heaving bosom,
she took up her festal garment and went away
trembling all over with joy.</p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Poor Jean! Suffering was a new experience for
him; he rebelled against this unknown power that
had seized him and was strangling his heart with
bruising hoops of iron.</p>

<p>Smothered rage, rage against that young man,
whom he longed to break in pieces with his own
hands; rage against that woman, whom it would have
delighted him to maul with blows of his spurs and
whip; all this he endured, and at the same time he
was possessed with I know not what urgent physical
need of action, an impulse to rush headlong into
some desperate piece of folly. He found, too, that
his comrades vexed and irritated him. He was conscious
that they cast upon him glances which were
already inquisitive, and might to-morrow become
ironical.</p>

<p>Towards evening he asked for, and obtained permission,
to go with Nyaor-fall to try some horses to
the north of the Point of Barbary. They had a
furious gallop over the desert sands in gloomy
weather, under a wintry sky—for out there, too,
there are wintry skies, less frequent than our own,
of a startling and sinister effect in that land of desolation—unbroken
clouds, so black and low that the
plain beneath appears white, and the desert seems
an interminable, snow-covered steppe. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
two spahis passed in their burnooses, carried at full
speed on their madly excited horses, huge vultures,
that were lazily walking about the ground in families,
rose in startled flight and began to describe fantastic
curves in the air overhead.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>At night Jean and Nyaor returned dripping with
sweat to their quarters, with their exhausted horses.</p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>But on the morrow of this one day of unnatural
excitement, fever attacked Jean.</p>

<p>On the morrow, the spahi, lying on his wretched
little grey mattress, was placed on a stretcher and
taken to hospital.</p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>Noon!... The hospital is as still as a great
mortuary.</p>

<p>Noon!... The grasshopper is chirping. The
African woman is singing in her thin voice her vague
and drowsy song. Upon the whole expanse of the
desert plains of Senegal the sun darts down its perpendicular
rays of torrid light, which the vast
horizon reflects in shimmer and glitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Noon!... The hospital is as still as a great
mortuary. The long, white galleries, the long
corridors are deserted. Half way up the high, bare
wall, lime-washed a dazzling white, hangs a clock,
pointing to noon with it slow-moving hands of steel.
The grey-lettered, mournful inscription around the
dial is fading in the sun, <i>Vitæ fugaces exhibet horas</i>.
The twelve strokes ring out painfully, with that
feeble tone that the dying know; that tone, heard in
feverish, wakeful hours, by those who have come
hither to die; that tone like a knell, tolled in an
atmosphere too heavy with heat to conduct the
sounds.</p>

<p>Noon!... The mournful hour, when sick men
die. The air of this hospital is heavy with fever, the
indefinable emanations, as it were, of death.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Above, in an open ward, are voices that whispered
softly; little, scarcely perceptible sounds; the good
sister’s cautious footsteps, as she moves carefully
over the mats. She comes and goes with a troubled
air, Sister Pacôme, with her pale, sallow face under
her nurse’s cap. Doctor and priest are there, too,
seated beside a bed, which is curtained with a white
mosquito net.</p>

<p>Out-of-door, through the open window, are sun
and sand, sand and sun, and far away, blue outlines
and shimmering light.</p>

<p>Will he pass away, poor spahi?...</p>

<p>Is this the moment when Jean’s soul will take its
flight thither into that overwhelming noontide air?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>...
So far from home, where will it find a resting
place in all these desert plains?... Whither will
it vanish?...</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>No. The doctor, who had remained there a long
time, expecting the final departure, has quietly withdrawn.</p>

<p>The cooler hours of evening have come, and the
breeze off the sea brings relief to the dying. To-morrow,
perhaps! But Jean is more tranquil, and
his head does not burn so terribly.</p>

<p>Down below in the street, outside the door, a
small negro girl sat crouching on the sand, playing
at knucklebones with white pebbles to keep herself
in countenance when any one went past. She had
been there since morning, endeavouring to avoid
notice, playing her little part, for fear of being
driven away. She did not venture to question any
one, but she knew very well that if the spahi were to
die, he would be carried through this door on his way
to the cemetery of Sorr.</p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>The fever lasted another week, and daily at noon
Jean became delirious. Each renewed attack was
regarded with anxiety. Nevertheless the danger was
over, and the disease conquered.</p>

<p>Oh those hot hours of midday, hours that weigh
most heavily upon the sick! Those who have had
fever on the banks of these African rivers know them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
well, those deadly hours of torpor and slumber.
Shortly before noon, Jean would fall asleep. It
was a kind of suspended existence, haunted by confused
visions and a persistent impression of suffering.
And from time to time he had the sensation of dying,
and for an instant he would lose all consciousness of
himself. These were his moments of peace.</p>

<p>Towards four o’clock he would awake and ask for
water. The visions faded, shrank away into remote
corners of the ward, behind the white curtains, and
vanished. Only his head continued to hurt violently,
as if boiling lead had been poured into it, but the
delirium had passed its climax.</p>

<p>Among these faces, gentle or grimacing, real or
imaginary, that hovered around him, he had two or
three times thought he recognised Cora’s lover standing
near his bed and looking at him kindly, but disappearing
as soon as Jean’s eyes were raised to his.
Doubtless he, too, was an illusion, like those people
from his village whom he imagined he saw there,
strange in demeanour, vague and distorted in appearance.</p>

<p>Yet, curiously enough, since he had seemed to see
him thus, he no longer felt that he hated him.</p>

<p>But one evening—no, he was certainly not
dreaming—one evening he really saw him there
before him, in the same uniform he had worn at
Cora’s house, with his two officer’s stripes shining on
his blue sleeve. Jean looked at him with his great
eyes, raising his head slightly, and he stretched out
his wasted arm as if to feel if there were really someone
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, seeing that Jean recognised him, the young
man, before he disappeared as usual, took the spahi’s
hand and pressed it, saying simply,</p>

<p>“Pardon me.”</p>

<p>Tears, his first tears, sprang to the spahi’s eyes
and brought relief.</p>

<h3>XX</h3>

<p>Jean’s convalescence was rapid.</p>

<p>Once the fever had left him, his youth and
strength soon gained the upper hand. But nevertheless
he could not forget, poor fellow, and he was
very unhappy. At times he fell into moods of wild
despair, and nourished almost savage notions of
vengeance. But this phase was soon over, and then
he would say to himself that he would willingly
endure whatever humiliations she might choose to
inflict, if he might see her and possess her again, as
before.</p>

<p>His new friend, the naval officer, came again from
time to time, and sat by his bedside. He spoke to
him almost as one would speak to a sick child,
although he was scarcely as old as Jean.</p>

<p>“Jean,” he said one day very gently....
“Jean, you know, about that woman—if my telling
you this sets your mind at rest—I give you my word
of honour that I have never set eyes on her again
since that night that you remember. You see,
there are many things, my dear Jean, that you don’t
know about yet. Some day you will realise; you,
too, that one must not take such a small matter so
much to heart.... In any case, as far as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
woman is concerned, I am quite willing to swear to
you never to go near her again.”</p>

<p>This was the only reference to Cora made by
either of them, and the promise actually restored
Jean’s peace of mind.</p>

<p>Oh yes! he realised clearly now, poor fellow, that
there must be “many things that he did not know
about yet,” that there must be—commonplaces, no
doubt, to people moving in a social sphere more
sophisticated than his own—instances of cold-blooded,
subtle perversity, outside the scope of his imagination.</p>

<p>Little by little, moreover, he grew fond of this
friend, whom he could not understand; this friend
once cynical, but now grown kind, who regarded life
with inexplicable serenity and light-heartedness, and
who had come to offer him his protection as an
officer, by way of amends for the suffering he had
caused him.</p>

<p>But Jean had no wish for protection; neither promotion
nor anything else appealed to him any longer;
his heart, so young still, was filled with the bitterness
of this first agony of despair.</p>

<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>... It was at Dame Virginie-Scholastique’s.
(Missionaries sometimes have veritable inspirations
in naming their neophytes.) It was one in the morning;
the tavern showed large and dark. As is usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with places of ill-repute, it was closed with thick
doors, reinforced with iron.</p>

<p>A small evil-smelling lamp shed its light on a
jumbled litter of objects, crowded painfully together
in the dense atmosphere—red jackets and bare, black
flesh, weird entanglements, broken glasses and
broken bottles on the table and on the ground; red
caps, negro bon-bons, spahis’ sabres, all in floods of
beer and alcohol. The temperature of the hovel was
that of a vapour bath. The heat was maddening,
the atmosphere dense with black, or milky, smoke,
and with the odours of absinthe, musk, spices,
soumaré, sweat of negroes.</p>

<p>It must have been a hilarious revel, and surpassingly
uproarious, but now it was over. There was
an end to the songs and the racket. Now followed
the period of reaction, of stupefaction that comes
after drinking. The spahis were there, some of them
dull-eyed, resting their foreheads on the table, and
smiling vacuously. Others still preserved their
dignity, bracing themselves against intoxication,
still holding their heads erect—handsome faces with
strong features, the lustreless eyes retaining their
seriousness with an indescribable expression of
melancholy and loathing.</p>

<p>Distributed among them, haphazard, was Virginie-Scholastique’s
whole pack of little twelve-year-old
negro girls and small negro boys.</p>

<p>Outside a listening ear could hear in the distance
the cry of jackals prowling around the cemetery of
Sorr, where for some of those now here there were
places already marked out beneath the sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Dame Virginie, copper-coloured, thick-lipped,
with woolly hair wrapped in a piece of red cotton—drunk
herself—was sponging the blood from a head
of fair hair. A tall spahi, with a young, fresh-coloured
face, and hair the colour of ripe corn, lay
there unconscious with broken head, while Dame
Virginie, assisted by a black wench more drunk than
her mistress, was sponging his wound with fresh
water and applying compresses of vinegar. She was
not actuated by motives of compassion—certainly
not, but by fear of the police. She was really uneasy,
Virginie Scholastique, for the blood continued to
flow. It had filled a whole bowl and it would not
stop, and the old harridan was sobered by her
anxiety.</p>

<p>Jean was seated on a bench in a corner, more
drunk than all the rest, yet still holding himself
stiffly, his eyes staring and glassy.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>He it was who had inflicted this wound with an
iron latch wrenched off a door, and he was still holding
the latch in his clenched hand, unconscious of the
blow he had struck with it.</p>

<p>It was a month since his recovery, and every evening
he could have been seen dragging himself from
tavern to tavern, foremost among the dissolute and
drunken, practising himself in the insolent airs of
rake and cynic.</p>

<p>There was still much in this behaviour that was due
to mere childishness, but the result was the same;
he had travelled along a terrible road during this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
month of suffering. He had devoured novels, whose
every detail was new to his imagination, and he had
assimilated all their unwholesome extravagances.
And then he had gone the round of the easy conquests
of St Louis, coloured women and white,
among whom his handsome person had secured for
him unresisted possession.</p>

<p>And to crown everything, he had begun to drink.</p>

<p>Oh you who lead a well-regulated domestic life,
seated peacefully day after day by your fireside, do
not pass judgment on the sailors and spahis, men of
ardent natures, whom their destiny has plunged into
abnormal conditions of life upon the wide ocean, or
in the far away lands of the sun, exposed to unheard
of privations, to desires and temptations of which you
have no conception. Do not pass judgment on these
exiles, or these wanderers, whose sufferings, joys,
tortured imaginings are unknown to you.</p>

<p>So Jean began to drink, and he drank more than
the others; he drank prodigiously.</p>

<p>“How can he do it?” said those around him,
“a man who has never been accustomed to it.”</p>

<p>It was precisely because he had “never been
accustomed to it” that his head was stronger, and for
the moment he could stand more. And this impressed
his comrades greatly.</p>

<p>Yet through it all, in spite of the rakish airs he
gave himself, like the big, undisciplined child he was,
poor Jean had kept himself almost chaste.</p>

<p>He would not stoop to a dishonouring intimacy with
negresses, and when Dame Virginie’s pupils let their
hands stray over him, he pushed them away with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
end of his riding whip, like unclean animals, and the
miserable little creatures came to look upon him as
a sort of human fetish whom they might not
approach.</p>

<p>But he was violent when he was drunk; when he
lost his head and his enormous physical strength was
no longer under control, he was terrifying. He had
struck that blow just now, roused by some casual jest
on the subject of his love affairs, and he no longer
remembered anything about it. He remained there
motionless, with lack-lustre eyes, still holding in his
hand the blood-stained latch.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes flashed. Now it was that old
woman who was provoking his unreasoning wrath, the
senseless rage of a drunken man. He half rose to
his feet, threatening her in his fury. The old hag
uttered a hoarse cry; she went through a minute of
horrible fear.</p>

<p>“Hold him,” she moaned to the inert beings who
were already lying asleep under the tables.</p>

<p>Some heads were raised; feeble, impotent hands
tried to hold Jean back by his jacket, but their efforts
were futile.</p>

<p>“Give me some drink, you old witch,” he said;
“some drink, you old devil of night; you horrible old
hag, some drink.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she answered, her voice choking with
fear. “That’s it! Some drink, Sam, some
absinthe, quick, to finish him off; absinthe laced with
brandy.”</p>

<p>In these emergencies, Dame Virginie did not consider
expense. Jean drank it off at one draught,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
flung his glass against the wall, and fell back as if
struck by lightning.</p>

<p>He was successfully “finished off,” as the old
harridan had said. He was no longer dangerous.</p>

<p>She was strong, was old Scholastique, sturdily
built—and wholly sober now. With the help of her
black wench and her little girls, she lifted Jean like
a dead weight, and after rapidly searching his pockets
for the last coins they might contain, she opened the
door and threw him out. Jean fell like a corpse, his
arms extended, his face in the sand—and the old hag,
after discharging a flood of appalling abuse and savage
obscenities, drew to her door, which closed heavily
with a loud clang of iron.</p>

<p>All was still. The wind blew from the cemetery,
and in the intense silence of midnight could be
clearly heard the shrill howling of the jackals, the
uncanny music of the body-snatchers.</p>

<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>Françoise Peyral to her son.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My dear son,—We have had no answer to our letter,
and Peyral says it is beginning to be quite time that something
came for us. I can see that he is very unhappy
whenever Toinou goes past with his box and says that he
has nothing for us. I, too, am very anxious. But I
always believe that the good God will guard my dear boy,
as I so often beg of Him, and that no harm can come to
him, nor any trouble, either through bad behaviour or
punishment. If there were anything like that I should
be too unhappy.</p>

<p>Your father wishes me to say that memories come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
his head of what he himself was like, formerly, when he
was in the army. And he says, when he was stationed in
garrison towns, he has seen young men, who were not
very sensible, have a rough time of it, through comrades
leading them on to drink and to mix with bad women,
who are always on the lookout to ruin them. I am telling
you this because he wants me to, but for my part
I know that my dear boy is steady, and that he has ideas
in his head which will surely keep him away from all
these evil things.</p>

<p>Next month we will send you a little more money.
Out there I expect you have to pay a great deal for
trifling things. I know you will not spend money unnecessarily,
when you think of all the trouble your father
takes. As for me, a woman’s trouble is no great matter,
and I speak for him, the dear man. The village folk
always talk about you at the evening working parties and
merrymakings, and no social gathering passes without
some conversation about our Jean. All the neighbours
send hearty messages.</p>

<p>My dear son, your father and I embrace you with all
our hearts. The good God keep you.</p>

<p class="center">Your mother,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Françoise Peyral</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>This letter was received by Jean in the prison
attached to the barracks, where he had been locked
up “for drunkenness, and for having had himself
brought back by the guard.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the fair-haired spahi’s wound was not
very serious, and neither the injured man nor his
comrades had wished to report Peyral. Jean’s
clothes were soiled and blood-stained, his shirt in
rags, and his head still confused with the fumes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
alcohol. Mists swam before his eyes, so that he
could scarcely read. And besides, a dense veil now
lay upon the affection he felt for the friends of his
childhood and for his family. This veil was woven
by Cora and his own despair and passions. (It is
thus, sometimes, during periods of bewilderment and
loss of balance. Then the veil fades away, and
quite tranquilly one returns to all that one used
to love.)</p>

<p>In spite of all, this touching letter, so full of trust,
found without difficulty the way to Jean’s heart.
He kissed it devoutly, and tears came to his
eyes.</p>

<p>And then he swore to himself to drink no more,
and as the habit was not yet inveterate he was able
to keep strictly to his promise; he was never drunk
again.</p>

<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>A few days later an unforeseen event created a
fortunate and necessary diversion in Jean’s existence.</p>

<p>The spahis were ordered, both horses and men, to
go for a change of air into camp at Dialamban,
several miles to the south of St Louis, near the mouth
of the river.</p>

<p>The day before their departure, Fatou-gaye came
to the quarters, wearing her fine blue garment, to pay
a farewell visit to her friend. He kissed her for
the first time on both her little black cheeks. At
nightfall the spahis set out on the march.</p>

<p>As for Cora, after the first moments of excessive
excitement and resentment, she missed her lovers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
In truth she missed both of them, both Jeans, each
of whom had appealed equally to her senses. Treated
by the spahi as a goddess, it was a change to be
treated by the other as the light woman she really
was. Hitherto no one had exhibited towards her
such calm, absolute contempt; the novelty of it
charmed her.</p>

<p>But she was seen no more at St Louis trailing her
flowing draperies over the sand. She took her
departure secretly one day, despatched by her
husband on the recommendation of the authorities,
to one of the most remote branches in the south.</p>

<p>Doubtless Fatou-gaye had been gossiping, and St
Louis was shocked at this last scandal in which this
woman had figured.</p>

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>It is a calm night at the end of February, a
typical cold weather night—calm and cool, following
upon a burning day.</p>

<p>The column of spahis bound for Dialamban is
crossing at a walking pace the plains of Legbar.
Leave had been given to break rank, each man at his
choice and pleasure, and Jean, who has fallen to the
rear, is marching quietly along in the company of
his friend Nyaor....</p>

<p>In the Sahara and the Soudan there are cold nights
such as this, possessing the clear splendour of our own
winter nights, but with greater transparency and
luminousness.</p>

<p>A death-like stillness pervades the whole country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
The sky is greenish blue, sombre and deep, with an
infinity of stars. The moon shines bright as day,
and defines the outlines of things with surprising
sharpness, tinging them with rosy light.</p>

<p>In the distance, farther than sight can penetrate,
stretch swamps overgrown with the depressing
vegetation of the mangrove tree. Such is all this
region of Africa, from the left bank of the river as
far as the inaccessible borders of Guinea.</p>

<p>Sirius is rising; the moon has reached its zenith;
the silence is awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Out of the pink sand rise the tall, bluish euphorbiæ,
casting a short, hard shadow. The moon outlines
the smallest shadows of the plants with a set and
frozen precision, intense in its immobility and
mystery.</p>

<p>Here and there are clumps of brushwood, blurred
obscurities, forming great gloomy patches on the
luminous, pink background of the sands; then sheets
of stagnant water, with vapour floating above them
like white smoke, feverish miasma, more noxious and
subtle than that of the day time. There is a penetrating
sensation of chilliness, strange after the heat
of the day; the moist air is all impregnated with the
odour of great swamps.</p>

<p>Here and there by the roadside lie large skeletons,
contorted with pain, carcases of camels, swimming in
a black, fetid fluid. There they lie, grinning at the
moon, shamelessly displaying their flanks, torn by
vultures, their bodies hideously disembowelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>From time to time the cry of a swamp bird breaks
the immense silence.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>At long intervals a baobab stretches its massive
branches into the still air, like a great dead madrepore,
a tree of stone, and the moon defines with surprising
sharpness the contours of its structure, rigid
like a mastodon’s, conveying to the imagination the
impression of a thing inert, petrified and cold.</p>

<p>In the midst of its polished branches perch black
masses: the inevitable vultures. Whole families of
them roost there confidingly, sleeping heavily; they
suffer Jean to approach, with the indifference of
fetish birds, and the moon casts blue reflections and
metallic gleams on their great folded wings.</p>

<p>And Jean is full of wonder at this first revelation
at dead of night of all the intimate details of this land.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>At two o’clock there bursts forth a chorus of yells,
as of dogs baying the moon, but more savage, more
grating, more weirdly sinister. Sometimes at night
at St Louis, when the wind blew from the direction
of the cemetery, Jean had fancied he heard in the far
distance similar lamentations. But to-night this
lugubrious music was close at hand, there, in the
brush. The dismal yelping of jackals mingled with
piercing strident caterwaulings of hyenas. A battle
was in progress between two wandering packs on the
prowl in search of dead camels.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Jean asked the black spahi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, perhaps, a presentiment: a kind of horror
seized him. The thing was undoubtedly there, quite
near him, in the brush, and the sound of these voices
made his flesh creep and his hair stand on end.</p>

<p>“Those who are lying dead,” replied Nyaor-fall
with expressive pantomime, “those who are lying
dead on the ground, these beasts find them and eat
them.”</p>

<p>And when he said “eat them,” he made as if to
bite his black arm with his magnificent white teeth.</p>

<p>Jean understood and shuddered. Afterwards,
whenever he heard at night these dismal concerts, he
remembered the explanation which Nyaor’s mimicry
had made so clear, and he, who in broad daylight was
seldom afraid, shuddered and felt chilled to the bone
by one of those vague and gloomy forebodings that
assail the superstitious mountaineer.</p>

<p>The noise grows fainter and dies away in the
distance; it breaks out again, somewhat muffled, at
another point of the horizon, then it ceases and all is
still again.</p>

<p>The white vapours that hang above the sleeping
waters grow denser with the approach of morning.
One is penetrated and chilled to the bone by the
glacial dampness of the swamps. It is a curious
sensation, to experience cold in this country. The
dew falls. Little by little the moon glides down the
western sky, is obscured, extinguished. The heart is
wrung by the solitude.</p>

<p>At last, low on the horizon, appear the thatched
roofs of the village of Dialamban, where at dawn
the spahis are to pitch their camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXV</h3>

<p>The land surrounding the camp of Dialamban is
desolate—never-ending swamps of stagnant water,
alternating with plains of arid sand, yielding a growth
of stunted mimosas.</p>

<p>Jean used to take long, solitary walks, with his
rifle over his shoulder, shooting or dreaming—ever
the same vague reveries of the mountaineer.</p>

<p>It amused him, too, to paddle a pirogue up the
banks of the yellow river, or to plunge into the mazes
of the creeks of the Senegal.</p>

<p>There were swamps, extending further than the
eye could see, where the warm, still waters lay asleep;
banks, whose treacherous soil would not support a
human foot.</p>

<p>White herons stalked solemnly among the monotonous
verdure of the mangroves. Enormous blowing-lizards
crawled upon the mud; great waterlilies,
white or rose-coloured, unfolded their beauty to the
tropic sun, to delight the eyes of alligators and
fish-eagles.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Jean Peyral came near falling in love with this
country.</p>

<h3>XXVI</h3>

<p>The month of May had come. The spahis were
gaily packing up their kit. With enthusiasm they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
struck their tents and put together their equipment.
They were going back to St Louis to take possession
again of their great white barracks, newly repaired
and lime-washed, and to pick up again all their old
pleasures—mulatto women and absinthe.</p>

<p>The month of May! In our land of France, the
lovely month of flowers and greenery! But in the
dismal plains of Dialamban May had brought no
verdure.</p>

<p>Trees and herbage, every plant not rooted in the
yellow water of the swamps, remained blighted,
withered, lifeless. For six months not a drop of
rain had fallen from the sky, and the land was
stricken with dreadful thirst.</p>

<p>And all the time the temperature continued to rise;
the strong breezes that used to spring up each evening
had ceased; the rainy season was at hand, the
season of sultry heat and torrential rain; the season
to which each year the Europeans in Senegal look
forward with apprehension, as bringing them fever,
anæmia, and often death.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to have lived in “the
land of thirst” in order to appreciate the delights
of this first shower of rain, the joy experienced in
exposing oneself to the big drops of this first burst
of storm.</p>

<p>O the first tornado!... In a leaden, impassive
sky like a gloomy vault, a strange weather sign
appears, rising above the horizon.</p>

<p>It rises and rises, assuming unusual and terrifying
shapes. At first one might imagine it to be the
eruption of a gigantic volcano, the explosion of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
entire world. It forms itself into great arches
across the sky, ever rising higher, one above the other,
with sharply outlined contours, in opaque, heavy
masses. One might imagine them vaults of stone
about to precipitate themselves upon the world, and
the whole is lighted on the under side with metallic
gleams, livid, greenish or copper-coloured. And it
continues to rise without a check.</p>

<p>The artists who have painted the deluge, the
cataclysms of the primeval world, have never conceived
scenes so fantastic, skies so terrifying.</p>

<p>And still there is not a breath of air. Nature lies
prostrate, without a tremor.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Suddenly a terrific onslaught of wind, like the crack
of a heavy whip, beats to the ground trees, herbage,
birds. It whirls the maddened vultures round and
round, upsetting everything in its track.</p>

<p>It is the tornado, bursting its chains. All things
tremble and reel; nature is convulsed under the
terrible might of the hurricane passing on its way.</p>

<p>For perhaps twenty minutes all the sluices of
heaven are opened upon the earth. Rain, as of the
great flood, refreshes the thirsty soil of Africa, and
the wind blows furiously, strewing the earth with
leaves, branches, and <i>débris</i>.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Then suddenly all is peace. It is over. The final
gusts of wind put to flight the last copper-coloured
clouds, and sweep away the tattered shreds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cataclysm. The hurricane is over, and the sky is
once more clear, impassive, blue.</p>

<p>The first tornado took the spahis by surprise, while
they were on the march. There was a laughing,
noisy stampede. The village of Touroukambé lay in
the way, and they made for it, helter-skelter.</p>

<p>Women who had been pounding millet, children
playing in the brush, hens pecking up food, dogs
sleeping in the sun, all of them had hurried home,
and were herded together beneath the narrow, peaked
roofs.</p>

<p>Then the huts, already overcrowded, are invaded by
the spahis, who step into calebashes and upset the
kouss-kouss. Some kiss the little girls; others peep
out-of-doors, like big children, for the pleasure of
getting wet and of feeling the rain from heaven
trickling down upon their heated, harum-scarum
heads. The horses, tethered haphazard, are neighing,
pawing the ground, kicking out in terror. Dogs,
goats, sheep, all the cattle of the village, are huddled
against the doors, yelping, bleating, leaping, thrusting
with heads or horns to force an entry—all
demanding their share of protection and shelter.</p>

<p>There is a discordant uproar—a mingling of shouts,
bursts of laughter from the negresses, the whistling
of the storm wind, and the thunder drowning all
other sounds with its mighty artillery. Wild confusion
prevails beneath the black sky—darkness at
midday, pierced by sudden flashes of green lightning;
rain in torrents, the deluge pouring down at its
pleasure, trickling in through all the chinks in the
dried up thatch—here and there administering an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
unexpected shower-bath to the back of a curled-up
cat, or to a startled chicken, or a spahi’s head.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>When the tornado was over, and order re-established,
the spahis took the road again, marching along
flooded paths. Across the sky flitted the last little
curious wisps of cloud, like little parcels of rags and
scraps of brown cloth, torn and twisted like curl
papers.</p>

<p>Strong, unwonted odours rose from the parched
earth, at its contact with these first drops of water.
Nature was preparing for new births.</p>

<h3>XXVII</h3>

<p>Fatou-gaye had posted herself since morning at
the entrance to St Louis, so that she might not miss
the arrival of the column.</p>

<p>When she saw Jean pass by, she welcomed him
with a discreet <i>kéou</i>, accompanied by a very correct
little bow. She did not wish to embarrass him
further while he was in the ranks, and she had the
good taste to wait two long hours before she came to
pay her respects to him in barracks.</p>

<p>Fatou had changed greatly. In three months
she had grown and developed a swift maturity like the
plants of her native country.</p>

<p>She no longer asked for coppers. She had actually
a certain graceful timidity, proper to a young girl.</p>

<p>A bou-bou of white muslin now covered her
rounded breasts, as is the custom with young girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
who have come to marriageable age. A strong scent
of musk and soumaré hung about her.</p>

<p>Her head no longer displayed its five stiff little
tails. She was letting her hair grow, and would presently
put herself into the skilful hands of the hairdressers,
who would pile up her locks into the complicated
erection which is proper to the head of an
African woman.</p>

<p>At present her hair was still too short, and it stood
out in a dishevelled woolly mass, which gave an
entirely new character to her face. Formerly
pleasing but comical, it had now become attractive
and quaint, almost charming.</p>

<p>She was a mixture of young girl, child, and little
black devil—a very odd little person.</p>

<p>“The child is pretty, Peyral, you know,” said the
spahis smiling.</p>

<p>Jean had noticed, certainly, that she was pretty,
but at present this fact interested him very little.
He tried to resume quietly his former mode of life,
his walks on the beach, and his long expeditions into
the country.</p>

<p>The quiet, contemplative months spent in camp
had done him good. He had almost regained his
moral equilibrium. His memories of his aged
parents and of his young betrothed, trustfully waiting
for him at home in their village, held him once
more with their wholesome charm and influence.</p>

<p>He had done with childish folly and bravado, and
now he could not understand how it was that Dame
Virginie had come to number him among her clients.
He had vowed not only to give up absinthe, but likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to remain faithful to his betrothed until the blissful
day of their marriage.</p>

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<p>The air was charged with sluggish exhalations,
seething with the vital odours and scents of young,
growing things. Nature was hastening to carry out
her vast plans of procreation.</p>

<p>Formerly, on his first arrival, Jean had cast a
general look of repulsion on this black population.
In his eyes they all seemed alike; they all wore for
him the same simian mask, and under that polished
surface of oiled ebony he could not have distinguished
one individual from another.</p>

<p>Little by little, however, he had grown accustomed
to these faces. Now he could distinguish among
them. When he saw the silver-braceletted, black
girls go by, he would compare them; one he considered
plain, another pretty, one refined, another
degraded.</p>

<p>In the end the negresses had for him individual
faces, just like white women, and he found them less
repulsive than before.</p>

<h3>XXIX</h3>

<p>June! It was spring time indeed, but a tropical
spring time—fleeting, feverish, full of enervating
odours and the air heavy with thunder.</p>

<p>Butterflies and birds returned, life was renewed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the humming birds had cast off their grey dress, and
arrayed themselves in their brilliant summer colours.
The whole country turned green as if by enchantment;
the leafy trees now cast a little shade, warm
and soft, upon the moist soil; the mimosas, in full
flower, looked like enormous bouquets, with pink or
orange sprays, where the humming birds sang in
tiny little soft voices, like the muted twittering of
swallows. Even the clumsy baobabs had put on for
a few days fresh leaves of pale, delicate green....</p>

<p>The plains were carpeted with strange flowers, wild
grasses, daturas with large, scent-laden calyces. And
the showers that watered all things were warm and
fragrant, and at evening, above the tall grasses sprung
up overnight, the ephemeral fire-flies danced their
rounds, like sparks of phosphorus.</p>

<p>Nature had been so impatient to bring forth all
this abundance that in a single week she had
exhausted all her gifts.</p>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<p>In his evening walks, Jean invariably came upon
little Fatou, Fatou with a head like a woolly, black
lamb. Her hair grew quickly—like the grasses—and
soon the skilful hairdressers would be able to
make something of it.</p>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<p>Marriages were frequent during this spring time.
Often at evening, during those enervating June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
nights, Jean would meet these marriage processions
meandering across the sands in long fantastic trains.
Every one was singing, and the chorus of all these
falsetto, monkey-like voices had a syncopated accompaniment
of handclapping and tom-toms. There
was something ponderously voluptuous, brutishly
sensual in these songs and this negro gaiety.</p>

<p>Jean used often to visit his friend Nyaor at Guet
n’dar, and the scenes of Yolof family life and
domesticity disturbed him.... How lonely he felt,
cut off from his own people in this accursed country!...
He thought of Jeanne Méry, the girl whom he
loved with the pure affection of childhood....
Alas! he had only been six months in Africa....
More than four years to wait until he saw her again!...
He began to say to himself that perhaps the
courage to endure his solitary existence might fail
him, that soon at all costs he might need someone
to help him to pass his term of exile.... But
whom?...</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye perhaps?... Oh come!... what
profanation of himself!... Was he to resemble
his comrades, old Virginie’s customers?... To
maltreat like them little black girls?... He had a
kind of self-respect, instinctive modesty, which had
hitherto preserved him from such degradation; he
could never stoop so low.</p>

<h3>XXXII</h3>

<p>He took a walk every evening. He took a great
many walks.... Thunder showers still fell....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
The immense, evil-smelling swamps, the stagnant
waters saturated with feverish miasma covered a wider
area every day. This country of sand was now overgrown
with tall, grassy vegetation....</p>

<p>The evening sun was pale as if exhausted by excessive
heat and noxious emanations....</p>

<p>At the setting of that yellow sun, when Jean found
himself alone in the midst of these desolate marshes,
where so many strange new things worked upon his
imagination, he was possessed by inexplicable sadness....
He cast his eyes all around the wide, flat
landscape, overhung with motionless vapours; he
could not understand what there was in the aspect of
things, so mournful and so abnormal, thus to oppress
his heart.</p>

<p>Above the damp grass floated clouds of dragon flies,
with great black-spotted wings, while birds whose
song was strange to him called plaintively to one
another among the tall grasses.... And the eternal
melancholy of this land of Ham brooded over everything.</p>

<p>In these twilight hours of spring time these African
marshes are steeped in a melancholy that no human
tongue could express....</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXXIII</h3>

<p><i>Anamalis fobil!</i> shrieked the <i>griots</i>, as, with eyes
inflamed, muscles taut, bodies dripping with sweat,
they beat their tom-toms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>And the whole assembly, frenziedly clapping their
hands, repeated <i>Anamalis fobil!</i> <i>Anamalis fobil!</i> ...
words whose translation would blister these
pages.... “Anamalis fobil!” the first words,
the motive and refrain of a diabolical song, delirious
with licentious passion, the song of the spring
<i>bamboulas</i>....</p>

<p><i>Anamalis fobil!</i> the howling of frenzied desire of
the sap of negroes heated to excess by the sun, of
burning hysteria ... the negro’s alleluia of love,
a hymn of seduction chanted likewise by nature, air,
earth, plants, and scents.</p>

<p>At the spring <i>bamboulas</i>, the young men mingled
with the young girls who had just arrayed themselves
in the pomp of their wedding finery. To a maddening
rhythm, to a frantic melody, they all sang, as
they danced upon the sand, <i>Anamalis fobil!</i> ...</p>

<h3>XXXIV</h3>

<p><i>Anamalis fobil!</i> All the big, milky buds on the
baobabs had burst into tender leaf....</p>

<p>And Jean felt this negro spring-time burning in
his blood, flowing like a consuming poison through
his veins....</p>

<p>He was exhausted by all this renewal of life,
because it was a life in which he had no part. The
blood that boiled in men’s veins was black; the sap
that rose in the plants was poisonous; the perfume
of the flowers was dangerous, and the insects were
swollen with venom.</p>

<p>In him, too, the sap was rising, the sap of his two-and-twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
years, but with a feverishness that
exhausted the source from which it sprang, and in the
end this terrible renascence would have brought him
to the verge of death.</p>

<p><i>Anamalis fobil!</i> How rapidly this spring advanced!...
June was scarcely over, and already,
under the influence of deadly heat, in an atmosphere
no longer endurable, the leaves were turning yellow,
the plants were dying, and the sere grasses drooped
earthwards....</p>

<h3>XXXV</h3>

<p><i>Anamalis fobil!</i> ... There are in hot countries
certain fruits of harsh and bitter flavour—such as the
gourous of Senegal—that are detestable to the
palate in our cool latitudes, but which, out there,
appeal to the taste in special conditions of thirst or
ill-health. You may have a passionate craving for
them, and they may seem to you curiously
delicious.</p>

<p>It was the same with that little creature with her
shock of black sheep’s wool, her body of sculptured
marble, and her glittering eyes, already fully aware
of what they asked of Jean, yet downcast in his
presence with a childish presence of timid
modesty.</p>

<p>This highly-flavoured fruit of the Soudan was
precociously ripened by the tropical spring, bursting
with poisonous juices, rife with morbid voluptuousness,
febrile and foreign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXXVI</h3>

<p><i>Anamalis fobil!</i></p>

<p>Jean had dressed for the evening hastily, almost
frenziedly.</p>

<p>That morning he had told Fatou to go at nightfall
to the foot of a certain solitary baobab in the marshes
of Sorr, and to wait for him there.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Then, before setting out, he had leaned on his
elbow at one of the large windows of the barracks,
troubled in mind, trying to think—to think, if that
were possible, while he drew a few breaths of less
oppressive air. He shuddered at the thing he was
about to do.</p>

<p>If he had withstood temptation for several days,
his resistance was due to the very complicated
emotions struggling within him. A kind of instinctive
horror still mingled with the terrible urgency of
his senses. And superstition, too, played a part,
the superstition inborn in a mountaineer, a vague
dread of charms and amulets, horror of I know not
what enchantments, what bonds of darkness.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he was about to cross the
fatal threshold, to sign some sort of sinister pact
with that black race, that darker veils would descend,
separating him from his mother and his betrothed
and all that he had loved and regretted in his home
overseas.</p>

<p>The warm twilight sank upon the river; the old,
white town turned rosy in the light, blue in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
shadows; long lines of camels were wending their
way across the plain, moving northwards to the
desert.</p>

<p>Already in the distance could be heard the griots’
tom-toms beginning, and the song of frantic desires.
<i>Anamalis fobil!—Faramata hi!</i></p>

<p>The hour of his assignation with Fatou-gaye was
almost past. Jean set off at a run to join her in the
marshes of Sorr.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>A solitary baobab cast its shadow upon their
strange nuptials. The saffron sky stretched above
them its impassive vault, melancholy, oppressive,
laden with electricity, with terrestrial emanations
and vital elements.</p>

<p>To paint that nuptial couch would require warmer
tints than any palette could provide—African words,
sounds, rustling noises, and, above all, silence, all
the odours of Senegal, tempest, sombre fire, transparency,
obscurity.</p>

<p>And yet there was nothing to be seen, save a
single, solitary baobab in the midst of a great, grassy
plain.</p>

<p>Mingled with his delirious infatuation, Jean still
felt a sort of secret horror, as he saw, contrasting
with the background of dusky twilight, the intenser
blackness of his bride; as he saw, close to his own,
the glitter of Fatou’s rolling eyes.</p>

<p>Great bats flitted noiselessly above them, their
silken-winged flight seemed like the rapid fluttering
of black cloth. They flew so low that they brushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
them with their wings, their bat-like curiosity greatly
excited by Fatou’s garment of white cotton, which
showed up on the parched grass.</p>

<p><i>Anamalis fobil!</i> ... <i>Faramata hi!</i> ...</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="PART_II">PART II</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>... Three years had passed....</p>

<p>Three times the terrible spring and the cold
weather season had come again; three times the
“season of thirst,” with its cold nights, its wind
from the desert....</p>

<p>... Jean was lying asleep on his <i>tara</i> in his
whitewashed lodging in Samba-Hamet’s house.
Near him lay his yellow dog, motionless, with open
eyes, his paws straight out in front of him, his head
on his paws, his tongue hanging out thirstily; he
resembled in attitude and expression those hieratic
pictures of jackals in Egyptian temples.</p>

<p>And Fatou-gaye lay on the ground at Jean’s feet.</p>

<p>It was noon, the still hour of the siesta.... It
was hot, very hot, extraordinarily hot. Call to mind
the most overpowering noons you have known in
July, and imagine a far greater heat and an intenser
light.</p>

<p>It was a December day. The wind blew very
softly from the desert, with its unvarying regularity.
Everything was withered and dead. The wind
traced upon the sand thousands and thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
little wavy fluctuating streaks, like tiny ripples on
the great sea without water.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Fatou-gaye was lying face downwards, resting on
her elbows. The upper part of her body was bare
(her indoor costume), and her smooth back sloped
upwards in a graceful curve from her shapely hips
to the extraordinary erection of amber and coral
which crowned her head.</p>

<p>Around Samba-Hamet’s hut there was silence, the
rustling movements of lizards, the buzzing of flies,
the shimmering of sand.</p>

<p>Fatou, half asleep, with her chin resting on her two
hands, was singing to herself. She sang airs she had
never heard sung, which were, nevertheless, not of
her own composing. They were the expression, in
strange, drowsy music, of her languid dreams, her
voluptuous lassitude; reflex action, the effect produced
upon her young negro girl’s brain by all that
weight of circumstances, manifesting itself in
song.</p>

<p>In that sonorous hour of noon, in that feverish half-sleep
of the siesta, how plaintive are the vibrations
of such a song, the vague, unconsidered result of circumstances,
a musical paraphrase of silence, heat,
solitude, exile.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Jean and Fatou have made peace. As usual, Jean
has forgiven her. The trouble about the <i>khâliss</i> and
the earrings of Galam gold is all over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The money has been procured elsewhere and sent
to France. It was Nyaor who lent it, in large silver
coins with very ancient effigies, which he had kept
locked up with many others in a copper chest. The
debt will be paid as soon as possible. True, it is
another weight on Jean’s mind, but at least his dear
old parents, who had counted on him, will not lack.
Their minds will be at ease. The rest is not so
important.</p>

<p>Sleeping on his <i>tara</i> with his slave lying at his feet,
Jean has a certain superb nonchalance, a certain
counterfeit air of Arab prince. There is no trace
remaining of the little mountaineer from the
Cevennes. He has acquired something of the
beggarly majesty of those men who dwell in tents.</p>

<p>These three years in Senegal, which have already
thinned the ranks of the spahis, have spared him.
His face is bronzed; his strength has developed; his
features are more refined, and their original delicacy
and beauty still more accentuated.</p>

<p>A certain lack of moral tone, periods of indifference
and oblivion, a kind of insensibility of the heart,
alternating suddenly with painful awakenings—such
are the sole effects that these three years have succeeded
in producing upon him. The climate of
Senegal has gained no further hold upon his powerful
nature.</p>

<p>He has by degrees developed into a model soldier,
punctual, vigilant, brave. And yet he still wears
only humble, woollen stripes on his sleeve. The
gold stripes of quartermaster, which have often been
dangled before his eyes, have always been refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
him. To begin with, he has no influence, and then,
above all, there is the scandal of living with a black
woman.... To get drunk, to go on the racket,
to be brought back with a broken head, to commit
drunken assaults by night with one’s sabre on passers-by,
to roam from tavern to tavern, to stoop to all
kinds of degradation—that sort of thing is all very
well.</p>

<p>But to have turned from the path of virtue—simply
for one’s own private pleasure—a small captive
living in a respectable house, and provided with
the sacrament of baptism—such a thing cannot be
tolerated....</p>

<p>Formerly Jean used to receive very violent reproofs
on this subject from his superior officers, combined
with terrible threats and insults. He had uncovered
his proud head to the storm, and then he had listened
with the stoicism demanded by discipline, concealing
under a certain semblance of contrition a wild desire
to avail himself of his riding whip.</p>

<p>Yet, for all that, he did not alter his course of
conduct by a hair’s breadth....</p>

<p>A little more dissimulation was practised, perhaps,
for a few days. But he kept Fatou.</p>

<p>His feelings on the subject of that little creature
were so complicated that wiser men than he would
have wasted their energy trying to analyse them.
As for Jean, he surrendered himself without understanding,
as if to the beguiling charm of a love-philtre.
He had not the strength to part from her.
The veil that lay upon his past and his memories grew
gradually denser; now he followed unresisting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
dictates of the perturbed, irresolute heart that
separation and exile had led astray....</p>

<p>And day after day, day after day, always that
same sun! To see it rising every morning at the
same hour with relentless regularity, bare of clouds,
with none of the freshness of dawn—this sun, yellow
or red, which the flatness of the landscape rendered
visible, as at sea, from its first appearance above the
horizon, and which, scarcely risen, began to convey
to head and temples a painful, impressive sensation
of burning heat.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>For two years now Jean and Fatou had lived together
in Samba-Hamet’s house. In the spahis’
quarters, the authorities, tired of opposition, had
finally acquiesced in an evil they were powerless to
abolish. After all, Jean Peyral was a model spahi;
only it was an understood thing that he would always
remain wedded to his modest woollen stripes, and
that he would never attain higher rank.</p>

<p>Fatou had been a captive, not a slave, in Cora’s
house—a fundamental distinction laid down by the
regulations of the colony, and of which she had
grasped the meaning at a very early day. As a
captive she had the right to go away, although her
mistress had not the right to turn her out. Once
she had gone away of her own choice she was free—and
she had availed herself of this right.</p>

<p>Moreover, she had been baptized, and this gave
her still greater freedom of action. Her small head,
as cunning as a young monkey’s, had realised this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fact, and had fully grasped the situation. For any
woman, who has not renounced the religion of
Maghreb, to give herself to a white man is an
ignominious act, punished by all the execrations of
the mob. But in Fatou’s case this fatal barrier of
public opinion no longer existed.</p>

<p>It is true that her comrades sometimes called her
“Kaffir!” and this hurt her feelings, curious child
that she was. When she saw bands of Khassonkés
arriving from the interior, recognising them from
afar by their high headdress, she would run to them,
shy and moved, hovering about these tall men with
their manes of hair, anxious to talk to them in the
beloved language of their common country.
(Negroes have the love of their village, of their tribe,
of the corner of the earth where they were born.)
And sometimes at a word from a spiteful little
comrade, the black men from the Khassonké country
would turn away their heads with contempt, throwing
at her with an indescribable smile and curl of the lips
the word “Kaffir” (infidel), which is the equivalent
of the Algerian <i>roumi</i> and the Oriental <i>giaour</i>. Then
little Fatou would go away, ashamed, and with a
swelling heart....</p>

<p>But, nonetheless, she preferred to be a Kaffir,
and to possess Jean....</p>

<p>... Poor Jean, sleep long on your light tara;
draw out this noonday hour of rest, this heavy dreamless
sleep, for the moment of waking is full of
gloom....</p>

<p>Oh that awakening from the torpor of the midday
sleep! Whence came that strange lucidity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
mind which made this moment so terrifying?...
His ideas began to waken, mournful, confused, incomplete—at
first mere inconsequent shadowy conceptions,
full of mystery, like traces of a previous
existence. Then suddenly dawned conceptions of
greater and agonising clearness. Radiant memories
of old days, impressions of childhood, came back to
him, rising from the depths of his irrevocable past,
memories of thatched cottages, of the Cevennes on
summer evenings, mingled with stridulation of
African crickets; the agony of separations, of lost
happiness, a swift and harrowing survey of his whole
past, the events of life seen from beneath, like things
beyond the tomb—the other side of existence, the
obverse of this world.</p>

<p>... In these moments, especially, he seemed to
be conscious of the rapid and inexorable flight of time,
which the tonelessness of his spirit did not usually
permit him to grasp. He woke up, hearing against
the resonant <i>tara</i> the faint throbbing of the arteries
in his forehead, and he seemed to be listening to the
pulsations of time, the vibrations of a great mysterious
time-piece of eternity. He had the sensation that
the moments were gliding by, passing, passing with
the speed of objects falling into empty space, while
the stream of his life bore him ever onwards, and he
was powerless to stem it....</p>

<p>He rose abruptly, now wide awake, with a wild
longing to be gone, in an agony of despair at the
thought of the years that still lay between him and his
return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Fatou-gaye had a vague instinct that this instant
of awakening was a dangerous and critical time when
the white man evaded her influence. So she was on
the watch for this moment, and when she saw Jean
open his mournful eyes, and then suddenly start up
with a bewildered look, she would quickly come and
kneel beside him to minister to him, or she would put
her supple arms round his neck and say,</p>

<p>“What is the matter, my white man?” in a voice
which she rendered as soft and languishing as the
sound of a griot’s guitar.</p>

<p>... But these fancies of Jean did not last long.
When he was wide awake his usual indifference
possessed him once more, and he saw things again in
their normal aspect.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>... The operation of dressing Fatou’s hair was a
very important and complicated one. It took place
once a week, and on this occasion the whole day was
given up to it. In the early morning Fatou set out
for Guet n’dar, the negro village, where in a hut
with peaked roof, built of thatch and dry reeds, dwelt
the hairdresser of most repute among the Nubian
ladies.</p>

<p>Fatou remained there for several hours, crouched
on the sand, surrendering herself into the hands of
this patient, painstaking artist.</p>

<p>The hairdresser began by pulling down Fatou’s
previous arrangement of hair, unthreading the beads
one by one, loosening and disentangling the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
locks. Then she reconstructed that amazing edifice,
introducing coral, gold coins, copper spangles, balls
of green jade and balls of amber—balls of amber as
big as apples, Fatou’s maternal inheritance of precious
family jewels, brought secretly into the land of
captivity.</p>

<p>The most complicated part to dress was the back of
the head, the nape of the neck. There Fatou’s
woolly masses had to be divided into hundreds of
little corkscrew curls, starched and rigid, carefully
ordered, resembling rows of black fringes.</p>

<p>Each of these corkscrew curls was rolled separately
round a long straw and covered with a thick layer
of gum. To give this coating time to dry, the straws
had to remain in place until the next day. Fatou
stayed at home with all these straws sticking out of
her hair. She looked that evening as if she had put
her head into a porcupine’s skin.</p>

<p>But what a splendid effect the next day, when the
straws were removed!...</p>

<p>Over this erection was thrown, in Khassonké
fashion, a piece of a very transparent kind of gauze
made by the natives, covering it like a blue spider’s
web, and this headdress remained firmly fixed day
and night for a whole week.</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye wore dainty little sandals of leather,
like the cothurnus of the ancients, with thongs passing
between the first and second toes.</p>

<p>Her dress consisted of the scanty, tight-fitting
<i>pagne</i>, which the Egyptians of the time of the
Pharaohs bequeathed to Nubia. Above this she
wore a <i>bou-bou</i>, a great square of muslin with a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
for the head, and falling like a peplus below the
knees.</p>

<p>For ornaments she had heavy silver rings, riveted
on wrists and ankles, and besides these, scented
necklets of soumaré, for Jean’s slender means did
not suffice for the purchase of necklets of amber
or gold.</p>

<p>Soumarés are plaits, consisting of several rows of
threaded little brown seeds. These seeds that ripen
on the banks of the Gambia have a penetrating,
aromatic odour, an odour peculiar to themselves, one
of the most characteristic odours of Senegal.</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye was very pretty with this towering,
barbaric headdress, which gave her the appearance of
a Hindu deity, decked out for a religious festival.
Her face had none of the characteristics, the flat nose,
the thick lips, of certain African tribes, which in
France are taken for the generic type of the entire
black race. She was of a very pure Khassonké type,
with a little, straight, delicate nose, with thin, rather
narrow, very sensitive nostrils, a well-shaped, charming
mouth, splendid teeth, and above all, great,
lustrous, blue-black eyes, expressing, according to
the mood of the moment, a curious gaiety or a
mysterious malice.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Fatou never did any work. Jean had presented
himself with a perfect odalisque.</p>

<p>She knew how to wash and mend her <i>bou-bous</i> and
<i>pagnes</i>. She was always as spotless as a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cat, dressed in white, partly from an instinct of
cleanliness, partly because she realised that Jean
would not tolerate her otherwise. But apart from this
care of her person, she was incapable of any work.</p>

<p>Since the poor old Peyrals were no longer able to
send their son the small sums that little by little they
had saved for him, since “nothing had gone well with
them,” as old Françoise had written, so that they
had even been obliged to have recourse to the spahi’s
slender purse, Fatou’s budget was becoming very
difficult to balance.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Fatou was a steady little person,
whose mode of life was not extravagant.</p>

<p>Throughout the Soudan, woman is in a position of
great inferiority as compared to man.</p>

<p>Several times in the course of her life she is bought
and sold like a head of cattle, and at a price which is
estimated at inverse ratio to her ugliness, defects,
and increasing age.</p>

<p>One day Jean asked his friend Nyaor,</p>

<p>“What have you done with your wife Nokhoudounkhotillé,
the one who was so good-looking?”</p>

<p>And Nyaor replied, with a quiet smile,</p>

<p>“Nokhoudounkhotillé talked too much, so I sold
her. With the money I got for her I bought thirty
sheep who never talk at all.”</p>

<p>The hardest work done by the negroes, the task of
pounding millet for the kouss-kouss, devolves upon
the women.</p>

<p>From morning till night, throughout Nubia, from
Timbuctoo to the coast of Guinea, in all the thatched
huts, under the burning sun, the negresses’ wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pestles are noisily pounding in the mortars of khaya
wood. Thousands of braceletted arms weary themselves
at this task, and the chattering, quarrelsome
workers mingle with this monotonous sound their
chorus of shrill voices, which seem to come from the
throats of monkeys.</p>

<p>The result is a very characteristic hubbub, audible
from afar in the thickets and desert tracts leading
to these African villages.</p>

<p>The result of this eternal pounding, which has
been practised by the women for generations, is a
coarse flour of millet, which is made into a flavourless
kind of gruel called <i>kouss-kouss</i>.</p>

<p><i>Kouss-kouss</i> is the basis of the nourishment of the
black races.</p>

<p>Fatou evaded this traditional labour of the women
of her race. Every evening she paid a visit to
Coura n’diaye, the woman griot, the ancient poetess
of King El Hadj.</p>

<p>In return for a small monthly payment Fatou had
the right to sit among the little slaves of the old
favourite around great calabashes, smoking with hot
kouss-kouss, and to satisfy the appetite of her sixteen
years.</p>

<p>From her raised position on her <i>tara</i>, where she
lay upon fine mats of complicated design, the old
cast-off favourite presided with imperturbable
dignity.</p>

<p>Yet these repasts were uproarious scenes well
worth witnessing. These small, naked creatures
crouched on the ground around huge calabashes, all
dipping their fingers at the same time into the Spartan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
brew. There were cries, wry faces, grimaces, tricks
that would have made an ouistiti jealous, untimely
invasions of great horned sheep; cats stealthily
stretching their paws out and then slily dipping
them in the gruel; intruding yellow dogs pushing
their pointed noses into the dish, and then bursts of
laughter, incredibly comic, displaying magnificent
white teeth set in gums as red as peonies.</p>

<p>Jean had always to be back in barracks at four
o’clock, but by the time he returned to his lodging
after retreat had been sounded, Fatou was always
dressed again, and her hands were clean. Beneath
her towering headdress, which resembled that of an
idol, she had assumed once more a serious, almost
melancholy, expression. She was no longer the
same person.</p>

<p>It was dreary at eventide in this desolate quarter,
in this isolated corner of the dead-alive town.</p>

<p>Jean would often remain leaning on his elbow at
the big window of his bare, white room.</p>

<p>The sea breeze fluttered the scraps of priests’
parchments which Fatou had hung by long threads
from the ceiling, as a protection to them during their
sleep.</p>

<p>Before him lay the wide landscape of Senegal—the
Point of Barbary, an immense plain, with the heavy
vapours of twilight brooding above it in the distance,
the deep gateway to the desert.</p>

<p>Or else he would sit in the doorway of Samba-Hamet’s
house, facing that characterless rectangle
of ground, surrounded by old brick buildings in ruins,
a kind of square, in the middle of which grew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
meagre, yellow palm, of the thorny species, the only
tree in the quarter.</p>

<p>Here he would sit smoking the cigarettes which he
had taught Fatou to make for him.</p>

<p>Alas! even this form of distraction he would soon
have to think of relinquishing for lack of funds.</p>

<p>He followed with his large, brown, lustreless eyes
the coming and going of two or three little negro
girls, who were chasing one another, gambolling
wildly in the evening air, like moths in the dim half
light.</p>

<p>Sunset in December almost invariably brought to
St Louis fresh breezes and great curtains of clouds
that suddenly darkened the sky, but never burst.
They passed over, high above, and glided away.
Never a drop of rain, never the slightest sensation of
humidity; it was the dry season, and in all nature
not one drop of water vapour could have been found.
Still, it was possible to breathe on these December
evenings; the penetrating coolness brought respite
and a sensation of physical relief, but at the same
time created an indefinable impression of deeper
melancholy.</p>

<p>And when Jean was seated at nightfall in front of
his lonely threshold, his thoughts travelled far afield.</p>

<p>These flights which his eyes, darting hither and
thither like a bird, would make each day on the big
geographical maps that hung on the walls of the
spahi’s barracks, he would often resume again in
spirit, especially of an evening, traversing a sort of
panorama of the world, as it presented itself to his
imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>First he must cross the great sombre desert, which
began just behind his house.</p>

<p>It was this first part of the journey that his
imagination was most slow in accomplishing. It
would be delayed in an infinity of mysterious solitudes,
where that interminable waste of sand impeded
his progress.</p>

<p>Then he had to cross Algiers and the Mediterranean,
reach the coast of France and ascend the
valley of the Rhône, to arrive at last at that spot,
marked on the map with little black shadings, which
he envisaged as blue-tinged peaks, seen among the
clouds: the Cevennes.</p>

<p>Mountains! His eyes had been so long accustomed
to the lonely plains; it was so long since he
had seen any mountains that he had almost forgotten
what they were like.</p>

<p>And forests! The great chestnut woods of his
country, moist and shadowy, where real streams of
living water ran, where the soil was earth, carpeted
with moss and delicate grasses.... He felt that it
would be a relief merely to see a small clod of damp,
mossy earth—instead of the dry sand blown about by
the desert wind.</p>

<p>And his beloved village, which in his imaginary
journey he beheld at first from above, as if he were
hovering over it, the old church, which he pictured
under snow, with its bell doubtless ringing the
Angelus (it was seven in the evening), and close by,
his cottage—the whole scene enveloped in a bluish
haze, on a cold December evening, with rays of pale
moonlight glancing upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it possible? Somewhere all this actually
existed; it was not a mere memory, a vision of the
past; it existed; it was not even so very far away;
actually at this moment people were living in that
very spot, and it was possible to go there.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>What were they doing, his poor old parents, at this
very moment when he was thinking of them? Seated
in a corner by the fire, no doubt, in front of the wide
fireplace, by the cheerful blaze of branches gathered
in the forest. He saw again all the objects familiar
to him from childhood, the little lamp lighted on
winter evenings, the pieces of old furniture; the cat
curled up asleep on a stool. Among all these friendly
things he sought to place the well-beloved owners of
the cottage.</p>

<p>Nearly seven o’clock! He had the very picture
before him. The evening meal was over; his parents
were seated in a corner by the fire, grown older, no
doubt; his aged father in his usual attitude, leaning
on his hand his fine grey head—the head of an old
cuirassier turned mountaineer again—and his mother
probably knitting, moving her long needles very
rapidly in her capable, quick, hard-working hands,
or spinning, with her distaff of hemp held very
upright.</p>

<p>And Jeanne—she was with them perhaps. His
mother had written that she would often come and
keep them company on winter evenings. What
was she like now? “Changed and grown still
prettier,” he had been told. What was that face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
like now, that face of the grown-up girl he had
never seen?</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>By the side of the handsome spahi in his red jacket
sat Fatou with her high headdress of amber and
copper spangles.</p>

<p>Night had fallen, and in the lonely square the little
negro girls continued to chase one another, flitting
hither and thither in the dusk—one of them entirely
nude—the other two looking like white bats with
their long floating <i>bou-bous</i>.</p>

<p>The cold wind incited them to run; they were like
kittens in our country, who feel an impulse to gambol
wildly when the dry east wind is blowing, which
brings us frost.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A pedantic digression concerning music and a class
of people called Griots.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>In the Soudan the art of music is confined to
a special hereditary caste of men called griots,
who are wandering musicians and composers of
heroic songs.</p>

<p>It is the griots upon whom devolves the duty of
beating the tom-tom for the <i>bamboulas</i>, and of singing
at festivals the praises of persons of quality.</p>

<p>When a chief feels a craving to hear the praises of
his own glory, he summons his griots, who seat themselves
before him on the sand and extemporise in
his honour a long series of special couplets, accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
their strident voices with the sounds of a
small, very primitive guitar, whose strings are strung
over serpent skin.</p>

<p>The griots are at once the laziest and the most
philosophical people on earth. They lead a roaming
life, and take no thought for the morrow. From
village to village they wander, either alone or in the
train of the great warrior chiefs, receiving alms here
and there, treated everywhere as pariahs, like the
gipsies in Europe—sometimes loaded with gold and
favours, like courtesans in our country—excluded
during their lifetime from religious ceremonies, and
after death from burial grounds.</p>

<p>They know plaintive romances with vague
mysterious words, heroic songs which hold a suggestion
of melody in their monotony and something of
the warlike march in their well-marked vigorous
rhythm; dance music full of frenzy; love songs like
transports of amorous fury, or the roaring of
maddened beasts.</p>

<p>But in all this negro music, as in that of all primitive
races, the melody varies little; it consists of
short, mournful phrases, scales of more or less unequal
intervals, beginning with the highest notes
within the compass of the human voice and descending
abruptly to the very lowest, in a dragging, plaintive
wail.</p>

<p>The negro women often sing at their work, or
during that listless half-sleep, which constitutes their
siesta. In that intense stillness of noon, a stillness
more impressive out there than that in our fields of
France, this singing of Nubian women, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
eternal stridulation of grasshoppers for its accompaniment,
has a charm of its own. But it would be
impossible to transport this singing from its exotic
environment of sun and sand. Heard in other surroundings
it would no longer be itself.</p>

<p>The more primitive, the more elusive the melody
appears by reason of its monotony, the more difficult
and complicated is the rhythm. As the long wedding
processions one meets at night meander over the
sands, they sing, under the leadership of the griots,
concerted choral music, weird in character, and the
persistent, syncopated accompaniment seems, as if of
its own sweet will, to bristle with rhythmic difficulties
and eccentricities.</p>

<p>A very simple instrument, reserved for the women,
plays an important part in this ensemble; it is merely
a long-shaped gourd, with an opening at one end;
this gourd is beaten with the hand, now on the side,
now on the opening, and two different tones are thus
produced, one sharp, one dull. It yields no other
sound, but the result obtained in this manner is nonetheless
surprising.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe the sinister, almost
diabolical effect, of a distant clamour of negro voices,
half-drowned by hundreds of these instruments.</p>

<p>The persistent counter-rhythm of the accompaniment
and the startling syncopations, perfectly understood
and observed by the performers, are the chief
characteristics of this form of music—inferior perhaps
to our own, certainly very different from it, and such
as our European tradition does not enable us
wholly to appreciate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h3>V<br />
BAMBOULA</h3>

<p>A passing griot raps out a tattoo on his tom-tom.
This is the summons, and a crowd gathers around
him.</p>

<p>Women come running; they form themselves into
a close circle, and begin to intone one of those
obscene songs which rouse them to passionate excitement.
One of them, the first arrival, breaks away
from the crowd and hurls herself into the unoccupied
centre of the circle, where the tambour is sounding.
She dances, jingling her <i>grigris</i> and beads; her steps,
which are slow at the beginning, are accompanied by
gestures appallingly licentious. Soon the pace is
accelerated until a state of frenzy is reached, which
might be likened to the antics of an insane monkey,
the contortions of one possessed.</p>

<p>When she comes to the end of her strength, she
retires breathless and exhausted, her black skin
gleaming with sweat. Her companions receive her
with applause or derision. Then another takes her
place, and so on, until all have had their turn.</p>

<p>The old women are distinguished by a more cynical
and reckless effrontery of indecency. The child that
is frequently carried on their backs is tossed about
in a terrible way, and utters piercing shrieks, but on
these occasions the negresses have lost even their
maternal instinct, and no consideration restrains
them.</p>

<p>In all the districts of Senegal the rising of the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
moon is the time especially dedicated to the bamboula,
to the evenings of the great negro festivals,
and above that vast expanse of sand, in the infinite
depths of these shimmering horizons, a moon rises
that seems larger and ruddier than elsewhere.</p>

<p>At the close of day the people gather together in
groups. On these occasions the women wear bright-coloured
<i>pagnes</i>, and bedeck themselves with ornaments
of fine Galam gold. Their arms are covered
with heavy bracelets of silver, and their necks with an
astonishing profusion of <i>grigris</i> and beads of amber
and coral.</p>

<p>And when the red disk of the moon appears, ever
magnified and distorted by mirage, casting up the
horizon broad, blood-red streaks of light, a frantic
clamour bursts from the whole assembly. This
announces the festival.</p>

<p>At certain seasons of the year the square in front
of Samba-Hamet’s house became the scene of fantastic
<i>bamboulas</i>.</p>

<p>On these occasions, Coura n’diaye would lend
Fatou some of her precious jewels to wear at the
festival.</p>

<p>Sometimes she herself graced it with her presence
as in old days.</p>

<p>And then there would be a general murmur of
admiration when the ancient griot stepped forward,
decked with gold, her head held high, with a strange
light rekindled in her dim eyes. Her body was
shamelessly exposed; her bosom, wrinkled like that
of a black mummy, and her breasts, which hung down
like pouches of skin, empty and withered, displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the wonderful gifts of El Hadj, the conqueror; necklets
of jade of the pale green of water, and besides
these, rows upon rows of great beads of fine gold of
rare and inimitable workmanship. Her arms and
ankles were covered with gold; she wore gold rings
upon all her toes, and upon her head an antique
erection of gold.</p>

<p>The old bedizened image set herself to sing. By
degrees she became more and more excited, waving
her skeleton arms, which could scarcely support the
weight of the bracelets. Her hoarse, cavernous
voice seemed at first to issue from the depths of a lifeless
corpse, but presently its vibrations gained a
shuddering intensity.</p>

<p>One listened, as it were, to a posthumous echo of
the voice of the poetess of El Hadj; and her dilated
eyes, shining with an inner light, seemed to reveal
like a mirror glimpses of the great legendary wars
waged in the interior of the land, and of the great
days of old; the armies of El Hadj swooping down on
the desert; the terrible massacres, when entire tribes
were given to the vultures; the assault on Ségou-Koro,
all the villages of Massina, covering hundreds
of miles of country between Medina and Timbuctoo,
going up in flames in the sunshine, like grass in a
prairie fire.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Coura n’diaye was very weary when her songs were
done. She returned home trembling in every limb,
and lay down on her couch. When her little slaves
had stripped her of her jewels, and had gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
massaged her to soothe her to sleep, she was left there
motionless as a corpse, and she continued prostrate
for two days.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Guet n’dar, the negro town, was built of grey
straw on yellow sand—thousands and thousands of
little round huts half hidden behind palisades of dry
reeds, and all capped with roofs of thatch. All the
peaks of these thousands of roofs affected pointedness
in all its extravagance. Some stood upright,
menacing heaven; others leaned sideways and
menaced their neighbours; others again were tun-bellied,
collapsing, seemingly weary of their long
drying in the sun, and anxious to shrivel and to roll
themselves up like the trunks of old elephants. And
all these roofs stretched away out of sight, printing
grotesque silhouettes of horned objects upon the
monotonous blue sky.</p>

<p>North and south through the middle of Guet n’dar,
dividing the town into two parts, runs a long sandy
street, very straight and regular, widening out in the
distance, until it is lost in the desert. The desert
does double duty as landscape and horizon.</p>

<p>On either side of this vast opening lies a maze of
tortuous alleys, twisted like the paths of a labyrinth.</p>

<p>To this quarter Fatou has guided Jean, leading
him, in negro fashion, by one of his fingers, which
she clasps in her firm, little black hand, adorned
with copper rings.</p>

<p>It is seven o’clock on a January morning, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sun scarcely risen. At this hour, even in Senegal,
the air is pleasant and fresh.</p>

<p>Jean walks along with his proud, sedate bearing,
smiling inwardly at the absurdity of the expedition
he has undertaken at Fatou’s desire, and of the personage
whom he is going to visit.</p>

<p>Good-humouredly he allows himself to be led
along; the walk interests and amuses him.</p>

<p>The weather is fine. The pure air of the morning,
the sense of physical well-being produced by this
unusual coolness, has a soothing influence upon him.
And at this moment, Fatou seems to him very
charming, and he is almost in love with her.</p>

<p>This is one of those fugitive and singular moments
when memory slumbers, and this land of Africa
seems to smile upon him; when the spahi surrenders
himself without gloomy afterthought to the life
which for three years has soothed and lulled him into
a heavy, dangerous sleep, haunted by sinister dreams.</p>

<p>The morning air is fresh and pure. Behind the
grey palisades of reeds, which border the narrow
streets of Guet n’dar, are heard the first sounds of
the <i>kouss-kouss</i> pounders, mingled with the sudden
clamour of voices of just awakened negroes, and the
noise of jingling beads. At each street corner are
skulls of horned sheep (for the benefit of those versed
in negro customs, the heads of victims of the
<i>tabaski</i>) set up on tall poles, watching all the passers-by,
and seemingly stretching out their wooden necks
for the sake of a better view.</p>

<p>And settled everywhere are great fetish lizards
with sky-blue bodies, swaying perpetually from side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to side, with the curious twitching peculiar to their
species; their heads, which are of a beautiful yellow,
as if made of orange peel.</p>

<p>The air is full of the odours of negroes, of leather
amulets, of <i>kouss-kouss</i>, and of soumaré.</p>

<p>Small negro children begin to show themselves at
the doors; their round bellies with projecting navels
are adorned with a row of blue beads; they smile from
ear to ear, and their pear-shaped heads are shaven,
except for three little tails.</p>

<p>They all stretch themselves, gazing at Jean with a
look of astonishment in their great, shining eyes, and
sometimes the most daring of them say, “Toubab!
toubab! toubab! good-morning!”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>All this savours of the country of exile and of
remoteness from home; the smallest details of the
smallest things are strange. But there is such magic
in these tropical sunrises, such limpidity in the air
this morning, such a sense of well-being produced
by this unusual coolness, that Jean replies gaily to
the good mornings of the negro babies, smiles at
Fatou’s remarks, surrenders himself, and forgets.</p>

<p>The person whom Jean and Fatou were going to
visit was a tall, old man with sly, crafty eyes, called
Samba-Latir.</p>

<p>When they were both seated on mats on the
ground in their host’s hut, Fatou began to speak, and
expounded her case, which was, as will be seen, a
serious and complicated one.</p>

<p>For several days she had been meeting, always at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the same hour, a certain very ugly old woman, who
looked at her in a curious way out of the corner of
her eye, without turning her head.... At last
yesterday evening, she had returned home in tears,
assuring Jean that she felt that she had been
bewitched.</p>

<p>And all night long she had been obliged to hold
her head in water to counteract the immediate effects
of the spell.</p>

<p>In the collection of amulets that she possessed,
there were charms against all kinds of ills or accidents;
against bad dreams and vegetable poisons;
against dangerous falls and the venom of insects;
against the wanderings of Jean’s affections and
damage by white ants; against colic and alligators.
But there were as yet no amulet against the evil eye
and the spells that people cast upon you in the street.</p>

<p>Now amulets of this kind were known to be a
specialty of Samba-Latir, and it was for this reason
that Fatou had had recourse to him.</p>

<p>Samba-Latir had the very thing. He drew from
an old mysterious coffer a small red sachet, attached
to a leather cord; he hung it round Fatou-gaye’s
neck, pronouncing sacramental words—and the evil
spirit was exorcised.</p>

<p>It only cost two silver <i>khâliss</i> (ten francs). And
the spahi, who did not know how to bargain, not
even for an amulet, paid without a murmur. Nevertheless
he felt the blood rising in his temples as he
saw the two coins vanish, not that he cared about the
money—for he had never learnt to appreciate the
value of money—but just now two <i>khâliss</i> was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
heavy tax upon his slender spahi’s purse. And
above all, he said to himself with a remorseful pang,
his old parents no doubt denied themselves many
things which cost less than two <i>khâliss</i>, and were certainly
more useful than Fatou’s amulets.</p>

<p>Letter from Jeanne Méry to her cousin Jean.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My dear Jean,—It is almost three years now since
your departure, and I am always expecting you to talk
to me about your return; I myself have faith in you,
you see, and I know that you would never deceive me.
But that does not prevent the time from seeming very
long. There are nights when I feel very unhappy, and all
kinds of ideas come into my head. Besides this, my
parents say that if you had really wanted to do so, you
could have taken leave and paid us a visit. I am pretty
sure, too, that there are people here in the village who
stir them up, but it is true, all the same, that our cousin
Pierre came home twice while he was doing his term of
soldiering.</p>

<p>There are people who spread a report that I am going
to marry that big gaby Suirot. What an idea! How
odd it would be to marry that great booby who plays the
gentleman. I let them talk, because I know that no one
in the world can be the same to me as my dear Jean.</p>

<p>You can be quite easy; there is no fear of their persuading
me to go to balls; I do not mind their saying
that I give myself airs. To dance with Suirot or that
great blockhead Toinon or others like him—no, thank you.
In the evening I sit very quietly on the bench in front of
Rose’s door, and there I think and think of my dear Jean,
who is worth all the others put together, and you may
be sure I am never weary of thinking of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Thank you for your portrait; it is just like you,
although they say here that you are greatly changed. I
myself think that your face is still exactly the same—only
you do not look at people in quite the same way. I
have put it on the big mantelpiece and arranged my
branch of palms all round it, so that when I enter the
room it is the first thing I see.</p>

<p>My dear Jean, I have not yet ventured to wear that
beautiful bracelet made by the negroes which you sent
me, for fear of Olivette and Rose. They think already
that I play at being a lady, and that would make it
worse. When you are here and we are married, it will
be different, and then I shall also wear Aunt Tounelle’s
beautiful necklace of little links, and her chain for scissors.</p>

<p>If only you would come! For you see I am wearying
for the sight of you. I seem gay sometimes when I am
with the others, but afterwards my sorrow grows heavier
and heavier, and I hide myself and weep.</p>

<p>Good-bye, my dear Jean. I embrace you with all my
heart.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jeanne Méry.</span></p>

</div>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Fatou’s hands, the backs of which were deep black,
had pink palms.</p>

<p>For a long time this discovery dismayed the spahi;
he disliked seeing the palms of Fatou’s hands, which
in spite of himself made upon him an unpleasant
impression like the cold paws of a monkey.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these hands were small and well-modelled,
and joined to the rounded arm with a very
delicate wrist.</p>

<p>But this discolouration of the palms; these parti-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fingers had something not human about
them, and inspired him with horror.</p>

<p>That and certain strange, falsetto intonations
which escaped her sometimes when she was highly
animated, together with certain restless movements,
recalled mysterious resemblances which troubled the
imagination.</p>

<p>In the end, however, Jean had grown accustomed
to these things, and no longer troubled his head
about them. At times when Fatou seemed to him
charming, and he was still in love with her, he would
call her laughingly by a curious Yolof name, which
signified “little monkey-girl.”</p>

<p>Fatou herself was very much mortified by this pet
name, and would assume staid airs and a serious
expression which amused the spahi.</p>

<p>One day (it was exceptionally fine that day; the
weather almost cool, the sky very clear)—one day
Fritz Muller, who was going to pay Jean a visit,
had noiselessly climbed the staircase and halted on
the threshold.</p>

<p>There he was very much entertained by the following
scene, which he witnessed from the door.</p>

<p>Jean, smiling the good-tempered smile of a child
who is enjoying himself, appeared to be examining
Fatou with great attention—stretching out her arms,
turning her round, inspecting her from all points of
view without uttering a word—and then suddenly,
with an air of conviction, he thus expressed the conclusions
at which he had arrived,</p>

<p>“You’re exactly the same as a monkey.”</p>

<p>And Fatou, deeply injured,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, Tjean! You not say that, my white man.
First a monkey not knowing how to talk—and I
knowing very well.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Fritz Muller burst out laughing—and
then Jean followed his example, especially when he
saw the dignified, ceremonious manner that Fatou
endeavoured to assume by way of protest against
these uncomplimentary conclusions.</p>

<p>“In any case, a very pretty little monkey,” said
Muller, who had a great admiration for Fatou’s
good looks.</p>

<p>(He had lived a long time in the negro realm, and
was a good judge of the pretty girls of the Soudan.)</p>

<p>“A very pretty little monkey! If all those in
the woods of Galam were like her, one might grow
accustomed to this accursed country, which assuredly
has never been visited by the good God.”</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>A white hall, all open to the evening wind, two
hanging lamps around which flutter large ephemerae
dazzled by the flame; an uproarious company of men
in red uniforms—coal-black kitchen wenches bustling
around—a great supper party of spahis.</p>

<p>It has been a day of festivities—military festivities—a
review at the barracks, races on desert-bred
horses, camel races, races of oxen with riders,
pirogue races—all the usual programme of a festal
day in a little provincial town, with the addition of
strange Nubian local colour.</p>

<p>All the fit men of the garrison, sailors, spahis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
riflemen, were to be seen parading the streets in
uniform; mulattos, men and women in gala dress;
the ancient Signard ladies of Senegal—the half-bred
aristocracy, erect and dignified with their high
headdresses of cotton foulard, and their two corkscrew
curls in the mode of 1820—and the young Signard
ladies in dresses of the fashion of to-day, yet in spite
of this, odd, faded, suggestive, somehow of the coast
of Africa. Besides these, there were two or three
white women in dainty gowns, and behind them, as
if to serve as a foil, a crowd of negroes, decked with
grigris and barbaric ornaments—all Guet n’dar in
holiday dress.</p>

<p>All the animation and life that St Louis could produce;
all the population the old colony could muster
in its dead-alive streets—all were out-of-doors for a
single day—ready to return on the morrow to their
listless existence in those silent houses, each in its
coat of white limewash, like a corpse in a winding
sheet.</p>

<p>And the spahis who have paraded by order all day
long on the Place du Gouvernement are roused to a
high state of excitement by this unusual stir.</p>

<p>This evening they are celebrating the award of
promotions and decorations brought by the last mail
from France; and Jean, who as a rule holds himself
a little aloof, is present at this supper party, which is
a regimental affair.</p>

<p>The black kitchen wenches are kept very busy
waiting on the spahis, not because the spahis have
eaten a great deal, but because they have had a prodigious
quantity to drink, and are all intoxicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>A great many toasts have been proposed; much
conversation has passed, extravagantly simple, or
extravagantly cynical—much wit has flashed—spahis’
wit, smacking strongly of its origin, a medley of disillusionment
and innocence. Many remarkable
songs have been sung—appallingly suggestive,
originating no one knows where, in Algiers, India, or
some other spot—the solos comically discreet—the
choruses terrible, and accompanied by the crashing of
glasses and the thumping of fists enough to break
down the tables. Old jokes have been made,
ingenuous and well-worn, exciting bursts of youthful,
joyous laughter, and words uttered capable of bringing
a blush to the cheek of the devil himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly a spahi in the midst of this crazy uproar
lifts his glass of champagne, and proposes this
startling toast,</p>

<p>“To those who fell at Mecké and Bobdiarah.”</p>

<p>A very strange toast this—not originating in the
brain of the author of this story! Quite unforeseen
this health that has been proposed! Is it a tribute to
the memory of the dead, or a sacrilegious jest. He
was very drunk the spahi who proposed this funereal
toast, and there was gloom in his irresolute eyes.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Alas! in a few years’ time who will remember
those who fell in the defeat at Bobdiarah and at
Mecké, those whose bones lie blanched already on
the sand of the desert?</p>

<p>The people of St Louis who saw them march away
may remember their names. But in a few years’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
time, who will be able to call them to mind and to
say them again?</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>So the glasses were drained to the memory of those
who fell at Mecké and Bobdiarah. But this strange
toast was followed by a moment of intense silence
and astonishment, and it cast a gloomy veil upon the
spahis’ banquet.</p>

<p>Jean, especially—whose eyes had been sparkling
with animation at the infectious gaiety of his comrades,
and who, as it happened, had been laughing
heartily all this evening, Jean relapsed again into his
dreamy, serious mood, hardly knowing why.</p>

<p>“Fallen there in the desert!” ...</p>

<p>Without grasping the full meaning of it, the idea
of it chilled him, like the sound of a jackal’s voice; it
made his flesh creep....</p>

<p>He was still very much of a child, poor Jean, not
yet inured to war, not yet a seasoned soldier. Nevertheless
he was very brave; he was not afraid, not in
the least afraid, of fighting. When there was talk
of Boubakar-Ségou, who was prowling with his army
through Cayor, almost up to the gates of St Louis,
he felt his heart leap. Sometimes he dreamt about
it. It seemed to him that it would do him good,
that it would rouse him to see shots fired at last,
even it they were directed only against a negro
chief. There were times when he was dying of
impatience....</p>

<p>It was solely with the idea of fighting that he had
become a spahi—not in order that he might pass a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
languid, monotonous existence in a little white house,
held spell-bound by a Khassonké girl....</p>

<p>Poor fellows, drinking to the memory of the dead,
laugh, sing, be very merry and foolish, and snatch the
fleeting moment of joy.... But song and uproar
ring false in this land of Senegal, and yonder in the
desert there are assuredly places already marked out
for some of you.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>“In Galam” ... who can divine what
mysterious echoes these words may awaken deep in
the soul of an exiled negro?</p>

<p>The first time Jean has asked Fatou (this was long
ago, in the house of his mistress),</p>

<p>“Where do you come from, child?”</p>

<p>Fatou had replied in a voice full of emotion,</p>

<p>“From the country of Galam” ...</p>

<p>Poor negroes of the Soudan, dwelling in exile,
driven forth from their native village by great wars,
or great famines, those vast catastrophes that come
upon these primitive countries—sold, carried away
into slavery, they have sometimes traversed on foot,
under the lash of their master, stretches of country
more extensive than the whole of Europe. But the
picture of their native land has remained graven
ineffaceably in the depths of their black hearts....</p>

<p>Sometimes it is far-away Timbuctoo or Ségou-Koro,
with its great palaces of white clay mirrored in
the waters of the Niger, or merely a humble village
of straw, lost somewhere in the desert, or hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
away in an obscure cranny of the mountains of the
south, and left in the wake of the conqueror a heap
of ashes and a charnel house for the vulture....</p>

<p>“In Galam!” ... the words are repeated
musingly, mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Galam!” Fatou would say,</p>

<p>“Tjean, one day I shall take you to Galam with
me.” ...</p>

<p>That ancient, sacred land of Galam, which Fatou
had only to close her eyes to see again—the land of
Galam, a country of gold and ivory, a country in
whose tepid waters grey alligators lie asleep in the
shade of tall mangrove trees, where the elephant
roams through the deep forest, trampling heavily
upon the soil in his rapid stride.</p>

<p>Once Jean used to dream of this land of Galam.
Fatou had told him very remarkable tales about it,
which had excited his imagination, sensitive to the
fascination of new and unknown things. That was
over now. His curiosity concerning all this land of
Africa had abated and worn itself out. He preferred
to continue his monotonous existence at St
Louis, and to hold himself there in readiness for the
blissful moment of his return to the Cevennes.</p>

<p>Besides, to go away over there to that country of
Fatou’s—so far from the sea—the one cool thing in
Africa, the source of refreshing breezes, and above
all, the means of communication with the rest of the
world—to go away into that land of Galam, where
the air must be hotter and heavier—to plunge into
that stifling atmosphere of the interior—</p>

<p>No. He no longer desired it. At present he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
would have refused, had a proposal been made to him
to go and see what was happening in Galam. He
dreamed of his own country, of its mountains and its
cool rivers. The mere thought of Fatou’s country
made him feel hotter, and gave him a headache....</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Fatou could never catch sight of a n’gabou (hippopotamus)
without running the risk of falling down
stone dead. This was a kind of spell cast upon her
family by a sorcerer from the country of Galam, and
all methods of breaking it had been tried in vain.
There were numerous instances among her ancestry
of persons who had thus fallen down stone dead at
the mere sight of these great beasts, and this curse
had pursued the family relentlessly for several
generations.</p>

<p>For this is a kind of spell that is fairly common
in the Soudan. Some families cannot endure the
sight of a lion; others that of a sea-cow; others—these
are the most unfortunate—that of an alligator.
And it is an additional affliction that in these cases
even amulets are of no avail.</p>

<p>One can imagine the precautions that Fatou’s
ancestors were obliged to take in the land of Galam—they
had to refrain from country walks at times
when the hippopotamuses chose to be abroad, and
especially to keep away from the great grassy swamps
where these monsters delighted to sport.</p>

<p>As for Fatou, when she heard that there was a
young tame hippopotamus living in a house in St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Louis, she always went far out of her way to avoid
passing through this quarter of the town, for fear of
succumbing to a terrible, consuming curiosity to
look upon the countenance of this beast, which she
persuaded her friends to describe to her in minute
detail each day—a curiosity which, as will be readily
divined, was likewise connected with the spell.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>The time passed slowly in monotony and heat.
All days were alike—the same routine of duty at the
spahis’ barracks; the same sun beating down on the
white walls; the same all-pervading silence. There
were rumours of war against Boubakar-Ségou, the
son of El Hadj, which gave the men in red something
to talk about, but went no further. Nothing
ever happened in the dead-alive town; tidings of
Europe came from afar, as if blurred by the heat.</p>

<p>Jean was passing through various moral phases;
he had his moods of exaltation and of depression.
As a rule he was conscious only of a vague sensation
of boredom, a weariness of things in general; then,
from time to time home-sickness, which seemed
dormant in his heart, would overwhelm him again
and make him unhappy.</p>

<p>The winter season drew near; the breakers off the
coast were calmer, and there were already breathless
days, when the surface of the warm sea lay smooth
and shining like oil, reflecting in its vast mirror the
strong, torrid light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Was Jean in love with Fatou-gaye?</p>

<p>He himself hardly knew, poor fellow.</p>

<p>He looked upon her, however, as an inferior being
on the same level, perhaps, as his yellow dog. He
did not trouble to try to fathom what there might
be in the depths of that little black soul—a soul as
black as its outer Khassonké covering.</p>

<p>She was deceitful and mendacious, little Fatou,
with an incredible blend of malice and perversity;
Jean had known this for a long time. But he was
aware, too, of her absolute devotion to him, the devotion
of a dog to its master, of a negro to his fetish,
and without positively knowing to what height of
heroism this sentiment might raise her, he was
touched and softened by it.</p>

<p>Sometimes his intense pride was roused, and his
white man’s dignity rose in revolt. The faith he
had plighted to his betrothed, and had betrayed for
the sake of a little black girl, accused him to his
honest conscience. He was ashamed of his weakness.</p>

<p>But Fatou-gaye had grown very handsome. When
she walked with her lithe, well-moulded figure
swaying from the hips with that grace of movement
which the African women seem to have borrowed
from the great felidæ of their country; when she
passed by, with her drapery of white muslin floating
like a peplum over her bosom and rounded shoulders,
she had the perfection of an antique statue. When
she lay asleep with her arms above her head, she displayed
the curves of an amphora.</p>

<p>Under that high headdress of amber her delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
face, with its regular features, had at times something
of the beauty of an idol of polished ebony; her
great, half-closed, lustrous, blue-black eyes, her
dusky smile, slowly revealing her white teeth, all
this had a negroid fascination, a sensual charm, a
power of material seduction, an indefinable something
which seemed to savour simultaneously of the
monkey, the young virgin, and the tigress—and all
this would race through the spahi’s veins with a
strange intoxication.</p>

<p>Jean had a kind of superstitious horror of all these
amulets; at length there were moments when this
profusion of <i>grigris</i> vexed and oppressed him. He
had no faith in them, to be sure, but to see them
everywhere, these negro amulets, to know that nearly
all of them possessed the supposed virtue of holding
and enmeshing him; to see them hanging from his
ceiling and on his walls; to find them hidden under
his mats and under his tara—charms everywhere,
little objects, old and witchlike, with a malevolent air
about them, and weird in shape—to wake up in the
morning and feel them being stealthily slipped on to
his breast—it seemed to him that in the end all this
would weave in the air around him invisible, shadowy
shackles.</p>

<p>And then he was short of money.</p>

<p>He said to himself very firmly that he would send
Fatou away. He would make use of these last two
years to win at last his gold stripes; he would send
his old parents a small monthly remittance to make
their life more comfortable; and he could still save
sufficient money to bring back wedding presents to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Jeanne Méry, and to make a respectable contribution
towards the expenses of their marriage feast.</p>

<p>But whether it was due to the power of the amulets,
to force of habit, or the inertness of a will stupefied
by the atmosphere, Fatou continued to hold him in
the hollow of her little hand—and he did not drive
her away.</p>

<p>He often thought of his betrothed. If he were
to lose her he felt that his life would be ruined. The
memory of her had a radiance. This “grown-up”
girl, of whom his mother had told him, who “was
prettier every day,” wore for him an aureole. He
tried to form an idea of her face, now that she had
come to womanhood, imagining the development of
the features of the fifteen-year-old child whom he
had left. She was the centre of all his plans for
future happiness. It was very precious, this possession
of his that was waiting for him over there, very
far away, in safe keeping at home.</p>

<p>The image of her, as she was in past days, had
already become a little fainter; that of the future was
still a little remote, and there were moments when
he lost sight of her altogether.</p>

<p>And his old parents! How much he loved them
too! For his father he felt a profound and filial
love—a veneration which amounted almost to
worship.</p>

<p>But perhaps it was his mother who still had the
warmest place in his heart.</p>

<p>Take sailors and spahis—all those forlorn young
men, who spend their lives far away on the wide
ocean, or in the countries of exile, in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the roughest and most abnormal conditions of life.
Take the worst of them; choose out the most reckless,
the most unruly, the wildest, look into the
deepest, most sacred corner of their heart. In that
sanctuary you will often find an old mother enshrined—an
old peasant from anywhere you please—a
Basque in a woollen hood, or a good Breton housewife
in a white cap.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>It is the beginning of Jean’s fourth winter season.</p>

<p>Days of overpowering heat without a breath of air.
The livid, leaden sky is mirrored in a sea as smooth as
oil, where numerous families of sharks are disporting
themselves. All along the coast of Africa the
monotonous expanse of sand lies blindingly white
under the reflection of the sun.</p>

<p>These are the days when the fish are engaged in
mortal conflict. Suddenly, without visible cause,
the smooth, polished surface of the sea is ruffled with
wrinkles, spreading over an area of several hundreds
of square yards. Bubbles and little whirling eddies
appear. This disturbance is caused by a great shoal
of panic-stricken fish, just below the surface of the
water, fleeing with all the speed of their million fins
before a school of ravenous sharks.</p>

<p>These days, too, are dear to the heart of the black
pirogue men, the days they choose for long voyages
and races.</p>

<p>On days such as these, when, to our European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
constitutions, the air seems too heavy to breathe,
when life ebbs away, and activity of any description
is beyond our strength—on days such as these, if
you happen to be lying asleep on a river-boat, in the
shade of a moistened awning, you will often be
wakened out of your unquiet midday sleep by the
shouting and whistling of the rowers; by the noise
of water rushing by under the feverish strokes of
the paddle.</p>

<p>This is a company of pirogues, passing by, striving
in fierce contest under a leaden sky.</p>

<p>And the negro population has roused itself from
sleep, and is standing in crowds on the beach. The
spectators encourage the competitors with loud
clamour, and out there, as with us, the victors are
received with clapping of hands, and the vanquished
with shouts of derision.</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Jean did not put in more time at the spahis’
barracks than was required for the exact discharge
of his duties, and often his comrades would take his
place. His commanding officers shut their eyes to
these arrangements, which permitted him to spend
nearly the whole of his day in his private
lodging.</p>

<p>He was now generally liked. The charm of his
intelligence and integrity, the charm of his personal
appearance, of his voice and bearing, gradually
brought everyone under an influence which was
unconsciously exercised. In the end, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
everything Jean had won for himself confidence and
esteem, and had attained a kind of privileged position,
which allowed him almost complete liberty and
independence. He knew how to perform the duties
of a punctual, well-disciplined soldier, and at the
same time to remain almost entirely his own master.</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>One evening Jean returned to quarters when
retreat was sounded.</p>

<p>The old barracks no longer wore their habitual air
of dejection. Men were standing in groups in the
courtyard, talking excitedly. Spahis were running
up and downstairs four steps at a time, as if possessed
with wild joy. It was obvious that there was something
in the air—something new.</p>

<p>“Great news for you, Peyral,” cried Muller the
Alsatian, “you are off to-morrow, off to Algiers,
lucky fellow.”</p>

<p>Twelve new spahis had arrived from France by
the steamer from Dakar; twelve of the senior spahis
(of whom Jean was one) were to have the privilege
of completing their term of service in Algiers.</p>

<p>To-morrow evening they were to leave for Dakar.</p>

<p>At Dakar they would embark on the French mailboat
for Bordeaux, thence they would proceed by
the southern route to Marseilles, with halts on the
way, affording those among them, who were
possessed of hearth and home, an opportunity of dispersing
and of paying them a visit. At Marseilles
they would embark on the mailboat bound for Algiers—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
land of Cockayne for spahis, where the last years
of their service would pass like a dream.</p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Jean returned home along the dreary banks of the
river. The starry night descended upon Senegal,
a night hot, heavy, amazing in its tranquillity and
luminous transparency.</p>

<p>The current flowed with soft, whispering sounds.
The tambour, the <i>anamalis fobil</i> of spring, which he
was hearing in this same place for the fourth time,
and which mingled with the memories of his first
enervating pleasures in this dark country, came to
him, faint, from a great distance. Now these
sounds were to herald his departure....</p>

<p>The slender crescent of the moon; the great stars,
twinkling in a luminous haze, low on the level sky
line; the fires alight on the opposite bank in the negro
village of Sorr—all these cast upon the tepid water
long trails of wavering light; heat dominated the
atmosphere, brooded over the waters. There were
gleams of phosphorescence everywhere, for all nature
seemed impregnated with heat and phosphorescence.
A mysterious calm hovered over the banks of
the Senegal, a tranquil melancholy pervaded all
things....</p>

<p>The wonderful, unexpected news were true. Jean
had made enquiries, his information was correct.
His name was on the list of those who were to go;
to-morrow evening he would sail down this river,
never to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>This evening no arrangements could be made connected
with the departure; the offices at the barracks
were closed; everyone was out. The preparations
for the journey must be put off till to-morrow; this
evening there was nothing to do but to dream,
collect his thoughts, indulge in desultory reverie,
and bid farewell to all that belonged to that land of
exile.</p>

<p>His head was distracted with troubled thoughts,
incoherent impressions.</p>

<p>In a month’s time, perhaps, he would be paying a
flying visit to his village, embracing, in passing, his
dear old parents—seeing Jeanne, changed, grown-up
and serious—and all this with the speed of a
dream.</p>

<p>This was the main idea ever recurring from minute
to minute, and each time administering a shock to
his heart, so that it beat faster.</p>

<p>But he was unprepared for this meeting. There
were all kinds of painful reflections mingling with
this great, unlooked-for joy.</p>

<p>What impression would he make, returning after
three years, without having gained even the modest
stripes of sergeant; bringing home no presents after
his long sojourn abroad; destitute as any vagabond;
without a sou in his pocket; without even having
had time to provide himself with a new outfit to
enable him to make a respectable appearance in the
village?</p>

<p>No. This departure was too sudden. The prospect
elated and intoxicated him, but nevertheless he
should have been allowed some days of preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, Algiers, that unknown country, made
no appeal to him. To have to go and acclimatise
himself elsewhere!</p>

<p>Whatever happened, he would have to serve out
far from home this term of years that had been carved
out of his life. So why not complete it here, on the
banks of this great, gloomy river, whose very
melancholy was now familiar to him?</p>

<p>Alas! unhappy man, he loved his Senegal! Consciousness
of this fact now dawned upon him; he was
bound to it by a number of private and mysterious
ties. Wild with joy at the thought of returning
home, he yet clung to the country of sand, to Samba-Hamet’s
house, even to that atmosphere of infinitely
dreary melancholy, even to that excess of heat and
light.</p>

<p>He was not prepared for so sudden a departure.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>The influences of his environment have filtered
little by little into the blood running through his
veins; he feels himself restrained and held a prisoner
by all kinds of invisible ties, shadowy fetters,
amulets of dark significance.</p>

<p>In the end, the ideas in his troubled head grow confused;
the unlooked-for deliverance fills him with
apprehension.</p>

<p>In this hot, oppressive night, heavy with thunderous
emanations, strange, mysterious influences contend
around him; one might imagine the powers of
sleep and death striving with those of dawn and
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>It is a sudden affair, this despatch of a draft of
soldiers.</p>

<p>The next evening, with all his kit hurriedly put
together, all his papers in order, Jean is leaning on
his elbow against the railing of a ship sailing down
the river. He smokes his cigarette, while he
watches St Louis fading away in the distance.</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye is crouching on the deck by his side.</p>

<p>With all her <i>pagnes</i> and talismans hastily packed
into four great calabashes, she was ready at the
appointed time. Jean had to pay her passage to
Dakar with the last <i>khâliss</i> of his pay.</p>

<p>He did this willingly, glad to humour this last fancy
of hers, and to keep her with him a little longer.</p>

<p>The tears she shed, the “widow’s complaints”
she uttered, after the custom of her country, were
sincere and heart-rending. Jean, touched to the
heart by her despair, has forgotten that she is ill-natured,
untruthful, and black.</p>

<p>The wider his heart expands with the joy of his
home-coming the greater is the pity he feels for
Fatou, a pity, moreover, not unmixed with tenderness.</p>

<p>At all events he is taking her to Dakar with him;
it will give him time to think over the question of
her disposal.</p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>Dakar is a kind of colonial town roughly constructed
on a foundation of sand and red rock, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
improvised port of call for the mailboats bound for
that western point of Africa called Cape Verde.</p>

<p>Great baobabs grow here and there on the desolate
dunes; flights of fish-eagles and vultures swoop
through the air overhead.</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye is here provisionally installed in a
mulatto hut. She declares that she will never return
to St Louis. There her plans end. She does not
know what is to become of her, and Jean is equally
ignorant. He has racked his brains in vain, poor
fellow, without hitting upon the vestige of a plan.
And he has no more money!...</p>

<p>It is morning; the mailboat on which the spahis
are to embark sails in a few hours. Fatou-gaye is
crouching beside her four miserable calabashes, which
represent her entire fortune, never uttering a word,
not even in answer. Her eyes are fixed and
immobile in a kind of dreary stupefaction of
despair, a despair heart-rending in its sincerity
and depth.</p>

<p>And Jean is standing beside her, twisting his
moustache, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door is flung open noisily, and a tall
spahi enters like the wind, in great excitement, with
animation in his eyes, and an expression of agitation
and anxiety.</p>

<p>This is Pierre Boyer, who has been Jean’s comrade
and room-mate at St Louis during the past two years.
Both intensely reserved, they have seldom conversed,
but they like each other, and when Boyer went away
on service to Goree, they shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>Removing his cap, Pierre Boyer murmured a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
excuse for his wild intrusion, and then he seized
Jean’s hands and said effusively,</p>

<p>“Oh Peyral, I have been looking for you since
before dawn.... Listen to me a moment. I want
to talk to you. I have a great favour to ask. Listen
first to what I have to say, and do not be in a hurry
to reply....</p>

<p>“You, lucky fellow, are going to Algiers.... I
alas! together with several others from Goree am
leaving to-morrow for the outpost of Gadiangué in
Ouankarah. There is fighting in those parts.
About three months to be spent there, and there’s
promotion to be won, no doubt, or else a medal.</p>

<p>“We have the same amount of service to put in;
we are both of the same age. It would make no
difference to your return.... Peyral, will you
exchange with me?”</p>

<p>Jean had already understood; he had divined his
purpose with the first words uttered. He gazed into
vacancy with his eyes wide open, dilated as if with
the torment he was inwardly enduring. A tumult
of hesitating, contradictory thoughts surged in his
head; with folded arms and bowed head he went on
thinking—and Fatou, who had likewise grasped the
situation, had straightened herself and sat with
heaving breast, awaiting what verdict might fall from
Jean’s lips.</p>

<p>Then the other spahi continued, speaking volubly,
as if to prevent Jean from uttering that word “No!”
which he dreaded to hear.</p>

<p>“Listen, Peyral, it will be to your advantage, I
assure you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“What about the others, Boyer?... Did you
ask them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they refused. But I expected that. They,
to be sure, have their reasons. It will be to your
advantage, Peyral, you see. The Governor of
Goree is interested in me, and he has promised you
his protection, if you accept. We thought of you
first” (with a look at Fatou), “because it is well
known that you are fond of this country. On your
return from Gadiangué, you would be sent to complete
your service at St Louis; that has been arranged
with the Governor. I swear to you that it would be
so.”</p>

<p>... “In any case, we shall never have time,”
interrupted Jean, who felt that he was lost, and was
clutching at a straw.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” ... said Pierre Boyer, with a ray of
joy already brightening his eyes. “We shall have
plenty of time; there is all the afternoon before us.
You will have nothing to bother about. Everything
has been arranged with the Governor; the papers
are ready. All that is required is your consent and
your signature—and then I go back to Goree and
return here in two hours’ time, and everything will
be settled. Listen, Peyral, here are my savings,
three hundred francs; they are yours. Perhaps the
money may be useful to you when you return to
St Louis and settle down, or on some other occasion.
Do what you like with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” replied Jean. “I don’t take
money for this sort of thing.” ...</p>

<p>He turned away his head disdainfully, and Boyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
aware that he had made a false step, took his hand
and said,</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, Peyral.”</p>

<p>And he held Jean’s hand in his, and they both
stood there, facing each other, troubled and silent.</p>

<p>Fatou, for her part, had realised that a word from
her might ruin all. She had merely thrown herself
on her knees again, softly muttering a negro prayer,
and had wound her arms around the spahi’s legs,
clinging to him.</p>

<p>Jean, vexed that another man should witness such
a scene, said to her roughly,</p>

<p>“Come, Fatou, let me go, I beg you. Have you
suddenly gone crazy?”</p>

<p>But to Pierre Boyer the pair did not seem
ridiculous. On the contrary, he thought the scene
touching.</p>

<p>A ray of morning sunshine glided across the yellow
sand and slid in through the open door, casting a red
light on the spahis’ uniforms, illuminating their
pleasant, vigorous faces, clouded with anxiety and
indecision, making the silver bracelets flash on
Fatou’s supple arms, wound snake-like around Jean’s
knees; emphasizing the dreary bareness of this
African hut of wood and thatch where these three
forlorn young creatures were deciding their own
fate....</p>

<p>“Peyral,” continued the other spahi, speaking
low, in a gentle voice.</p>

<p>“You see, Peyral, I am an Algerian. You know
what that means. My good old parents live at
Blidah, and they are waiting for me. They have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
one but me. You, Peyral, will understand what it
means to return to one’s home.”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>“Very well, then, yes!” said Jean, pushing his
red cap to the back of his head, and stamping on the
ground, “Yes! I agree. I will exchange with you
and stay.”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>The spahi Boyer clasped him in his arms and
embraced him. Fatou, still grovelling on the
ground, uttered a cry of triumph, then hid her face
against Jean’s knees, with a kind of wild animal’s
roar, ending in a burst of hysterical laughter,
followed by sobs.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>Time was short. Pierre Boyer departed with the
same mad haste with which he had come, carrying
with him to Goree the precious document to which
poor Jean had affixed a true soldier’s signature,
large, correct, and legible.</p>

<p>When the last moment arrived, all the papers were
in order, countersigned and initialled, the baggage
had been transhipped, and the exchange effected.
The whole affair had been patched up in such haste
that the two spahis had scarcely had time to think.</p>

<p>At three o’clock precisely the mail boat sailed with
Pierre Boyer on board.</p>

<p>And Jean remained behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<h3>XX</h3>

<p>But when the thing was done and past recall,
when Jean found himself standing there on the sea-shore
watching the ship’s departure, a frantic despair
seized his heart—a terrible agony, mingled with
terror at this thing that he had done; rage against
Fatou, a horror of the black girl’s proximity, and a
need, as it were, of chasing her from him—together
with a newly kindled, immense, and profound love
for his cherished home, and the dear ones who were
waiting for him there, and whom now he was not to
see....</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he had signed a compact
to the death with this sombre land, and that this
was the end of him.</p>

<p>And he rushed away across the dunes, hardly conscious
of where he was going—urged on by a longing
to breathe the air, to be alone, and especially to
follow with his eyes as long as possible this ship that
was speeding away....</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>When he set out, the sun was still high and
scorchingly hot; in the full light, these desert plains
had an impressive majesty. He walked for a long
time by the desolate shore, over the ridge of the sandhills,
or along the top of the red cliffs, so that he
might command a more distant view. A high wind
blew upon him, and ruffled the immense stretch of
sea that lay at his feet, and still he saw the ship
speeding onwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>He was so distraught that he no longer felt the
sun burning him.</p>

<p>Riveted for two more years to this country, when
at this very moment he might have been on yonder
ship, sailing over the sea, on his way to his beloved
village....</p>

<p>Good God! What were these sinister influences,
spells, and amulets that had held him back?</p>

<p>Two years! Would the time ever be fulfilled?
Would there indeed be an end of it, a deliverance
from this exile?...</p>

<p>And he ran towards the north in the direction the
ship had taken, that he might not lose sight of her
yet. Thorny plants tore him; a swarm of large,
wild crickets, disturbed among the grasses that
flourish in the winter season, flew against his breast
like hail....</p>

<p>He was very far away, alone in the midst of that
austere landscape, the silent and melancholy region
of Cape Verde. For a long time he had seen ahead
of him a great solitary tree, larger even than the
baobabs, with dense, dark foliage, a tree so huge that
it might have been taken for one of those giants of
the flora of the ancient world, remaining there forgotten
through the centuries.</p>

<p>Exhausted, he sat down on the sand under the
dome-like shade, with bowed head, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>When he rose to his feet, the ship had disappeared,
and it was evening.</p>

<p>At evening the mournful country grew stiller and
colder. In the twilight the great tree appeared as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
mass of absolute blackness, rearing itself aloft in the
midst of the vast African solitude.</p>

<p>Before him in the distance lay the pacified sea,
infinitely calm; beneath him, at his feet, the cliffs
descending in terraces to the great Cape Verde; flat
stretches of land, intersected by straight ravines bare
of vegetation—a wide landscape of a heart-rending
dreariness of aspect.</p>

<p>Behind him, on the side verging upon the interior,
rose mysterious ridges of low hills, stretching away
out of sight, and distant outlines of baobabs,
resembling silhouettes of madrepores.</p>

<p>Not a breath of air disturbs the dense atmosphere;
the sun, already obscured, sinks down among heavy
vapours, its yellow disk strangely magnified and distorted
by the mirage.... All over the sand the
daturas open their great white calyces to the influence
of evening; the air is heavy with their unwholesome
perfume and charged with the maleficent scent of
belladonna. Moths flutter about the poisonous
flowers. Everywhere among the tall grasses is heard
the plaintive call of the turtle doves. This whole
land of Africa is shrouded in a deadly vapour, and
already the horizon is vague and sombre.</p>

<p>Yonder, behind him, lies that mysterious interior
of the land, which once inspired his dreams, ...
but now, between this and Podor or Medina or the
country of Galam or mysterious Timbuctoo, there is
nothing, absolutely nothing, that he would care to
see.</p>

<p>He knows, or can imagine, all the melancholy,
all the suffocating heat of this land. His thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
are elsewhere now—in a word, this whole country
fills him with dread.</p>

<p>His one desire is to break away from all these
nightmares, to depart, to go hence at all costs.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Tall, wild-looking African shepherds pass by,
driving before them to the village their lean herds of
hump-backed cattle.</p>

<p>That simulacrum of the sun, which the Bible would
have called “a sign in the heavens,” fades slowly like
a pale meteor. Night is here.... All things are
veiled in unhealthy vapour, and the silence grows
intense.... Beneath the great tree it is still and
dark as in a temple.</p>

<p>And Jean dreams of his cottage, with the aspect it
wears at this hour on summer evenings; of his old
mother and his betrothed. And it seems to him
that all is over; he dreams that he is dead, and that
he will never see them again.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>The die was cast, and he must go where he was
sent. Two days later Jean embarked, in his friend’s
stead, on a small warship for the distant outpost of
Gadiangué in the Ouankarah. Some troops and
munitions were being sent to reinforce that forlorn
outpost. The surrounding country was disturbed.
Caravans no longer passed by; there were conflicting
negro interests, strife between rapacious tribes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
predatory chiefs. It was thought that this state of
affairs would come to an end with the winter season,
and when the force returned in two or three months’
time, Jean would be sent back to St Louis, there to
complete his service, as the Governor of Goree had
promised the spahi Boyer.</p>

<p>The little vessel was overcrowded. First of all,
there was Fatou, who had succeeded in securing a
passage by dint of importunity and subterfuge, claiming
to be the wife of a black rifleman. She was there
in the capacity of follower, with her four calabashes
and all her possessions.</p>

<p>There were about ten spahis from the garrison of
Goree, who were being sent into the exile of
camp for a season; besides these, some twenty
native riflemen, dragging their entire families along
with them.</p>

<p>These native troops brought with them a remarkable
equipage—several wives and children to each
man, millet in calabashes for food, and in addition,
clothing, household utensils—all packed in calabashes—with
amulets in heaps and domestic animals
in herds.</p>

<p>At the time of departure the deck was a scene of
violent commotion and confusion. At first sight it
seemed as if this medley of people and things would
never be reduced to order.</p>

<p>Not so, however. After they had been an hour
under way, the kit was piled up in miraculous order,
and all was still. The negresses who were on board
lay asleep on deck, rolled in their <i>pagnes</i>, packed as
tightly and lying as quietly as fish in a tin, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
ship glided smoothly towards the south, cleaving its
way steadily towards regions of ever intenser heat
and ever bluer skies.</p>

<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>A night of intense calm on the equatorial sea.
In the midst of absolute stillness, the lightest
rustlings of the sails are audible—from time to time
a negress, sleeping on deck, utters a groan; the
vibrations of the human voice are startlingly loud.</p>

<p>All things lie in a tepid stupor. The atmosphere
is sluggish with the dull torpor of a slumbering
world.</p>

<p>The milky, phosphorescent sea reflects in its vast
mirror the hot transparent night. One might fancy
oneself between two mirrors, opposite one to the
other, eternally reflecting each other, or imagine
oneself suspended in vacancy, for no longer is there
a distinguishable horizon.</p>

<p>In the distance the two planes are merged in one.
Sky and water, both are blended in cosmic, vague,
infinite depths.</p>

<p>And the moon is very low in the sky, a great disk
of red, rayless fire, hanging in the midst of a world
of pale, flax-coloured, phosphorescent vapours.</p>

<p>In the earliest geological ages, before day was
divided from night, the universe must have been permeated
with this same expectant calm. The pauses
between the acts of creation must have been fraught
with this same indescribable immobility in those
epochs when the worlds were yet nebulous, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
light was still diffused and vague, when the brooding
clouds were vapourous lead and iron, when infinite
and eternal matter was sublimated by the intense
heat of aboriginal chaos.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>The voyage has lasted three days.</p>

<p>At sunrise the whole world is bathed in a dazzling
golden light.</p>

<p>And on this fourth day the rising sun reveals in the
east a long line of green—which is at first likewise
tinged with gold, changing to a shade so unnaturally
vivid that one might compare it to the precise and
delicate colouring on a Chinese fan.</p>

<p>This line is the coast of Guinea.</p>

<p>The troopship has arrived at the Diakhallémé
outlet, and is approaching the wide entrance to the
river.</p>

<p>The land there is as flat as Senegal, but its natural
characteristics are different. With it begins a region
where the leaves never fall.</p>

<p>The whole country is covered with wonderful
verdure, a verdure already equatorial, a verdure that
never dies—an emerald green whose vividness is
never matched by that of our own trees, even in the
radiant month of June.</p>

<p>Further than the eye can see there is nothing but
this one interminable forest, of an unvarying flatness,
mirrored in the warm, stagnant water, an unhealthy
forest whose damp soil teems with reptiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>In this country, too, there was a melancholy stillness,
yet it was restful to eyes accustomed to those
desert sands.</p>

<p>At the village of Poupoubal on the Diakhallémé
the vessel halted, unable to sail further up the river.</p>

<p>The passengers disembarked and waited for the
canoes or pirogues which were to convey them to
their destination.</p>

<h3>XXV</h3>

<p>At nine o’clock one night in July, Fatou and the
spahis from Goree took their places in a canoe
manned by ten black rowers, under the orders of
Samba-Boubou, a skilful skipper, a pilot with experience
of the rivers of Guinea. They were bound for
the outpost of Gadiangué, which was situated several
leagues higher up the river.</p>

<p>It was a night without a moon, but cloudless, hot,
and starry—a night characteristic of the equator.</p>

<p>They glided up the calm river with surprising
speed, borne towards the interior on the swift
current, aided by the indefatigable efforts of the
rowers.</p>

<p>In the darkness both banks slid past mysteriously;
the trees, massed together in the gloom, flitted away
like great shadows. Forest after forest sped by.</p>

<p>Samba-Boubou led the chorus of the rowers; his
mournful, shrill voice would pitch upon a wild, high
note, then trail plaintively down to the depths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
base, and the choir would take up the burden in slow,
solemn tones; during the long hours the same
strange phrase was repeated again and again, with the
same response from the rowers. For a long time
they sang the praises of the spahis, their horses, even
their dogs; then of the warriors of the family of
Soumaré, and then of Saboutané, a legendary
woman of the banks of the Gambia.</p>

<p>And when the regular movement of the oars
flagged under the influence of weariness or sleep,
Samba-Boubou made a hissing sound between his
teeth, and this snake-like noise, repeated by all the
rowers, rekindled their ardour as if by magic.</p>

<p>Thus they glided at dead of night through the
whole length of the sacred wood of the Mandinga
religion, and overhead the ancient trees stretched out
their massive grey branches, angular shapes like
structures of gigantic bones, rigid as stone, their outlines
vaguely revealed in the diffused starlight, until
they passed out of sight.</p>

<p>Mingled with the singing of the negroes and the
sound of the flowing water were the weird voices of
monkeys screaming in the woods, or the shrieks of
birds of the swamp; all the calls, all the mournful
cries that are heard at night in the echoing forests.
There were human cries, too, sometimes—death
cries heard from afar, fusillades and the muffled
sounds of the war tom-toms. Here and there, when
the canoe passed by the outskirts of some African
village, the glare of great incendiary fires could be
seen in the sky. War was already being waged
through all this region. Sarakholes against Landoumans;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Nalous against Toubacayes; and right and
left villages were going up in flames.</p>

<p>And then, league after league, all was still again
with the silence of night and the deep forests. And
ever the same monotonous singing, the same sound of
the oars cleaving the dark waters; the same fantastic
voyage as through a land of shadows; the river bearing
them ever onwards on its swift current; silhouettes
of tall palm trees ever gliding past overhead;
forest ever succeeding forest.</p>

<p>The speed at which they travelled seemed to
increase from hour to hour. The river had dwindled
surprisingly; it was now a mere stream, flowing
through the woods, and carrying them deeper into
the interior. The night was profound.</p>

<p>The negroes’ songs of praise continued. Samba-Boubou
still uttered his weird head note, with which
mingled the shrieks of monkeys, and the chorus still
made its sombre response. They sang as if in a kind
of dream, and they rowed furiously, with superhuman
strength, as if galvanised, in a feverish
anxiety to reach their goal.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>At last they come to a place where the river flows
between deep banks formed by two chains of wooded
hills. Lights appear high up on a great rock which
stands out in front of them; the lights seem to be
moving hastily down to the banks. Samba-Boubou
kindles a torch and utters a rallying cry. The
garrison of Gadiangué are here to greet them. They
have reached their destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Gadiangué is perched there on the summit of this
perpendicular rock, and is reached by steep paths,
where negroes show them the way with torches. A
large hut has been made ready for the spahis, and
they lie down on mats to sleep until morning, which
is not far off.</p>

<h3>XXVI</h3>

<p>The first to awake after barely an hour’s sleep,
Jean opens his eyes and sees the white light of dawn
filtering between the planks of the hut, shining upon
the young men, who are lying half-naked on the
ground, their heads pillowed on their red jackets—Bretons,
Alsatians, Picards—almost all of them
fair-haired men from the north. In this moment of
waking, Jean had a kind of prophetic vision, a mournful,
mysterious, comprehensive foreknowledge of the
destiny of all these exiles, their lives menaced by
an ever-lurking death and recklessly cast away.</p>

<p>Close to him lay a graceful feminine form with
two black, silver-braceletted arms curving towards
him as if to embrace him.</p>

<p>Then, little by little, he remembered that he had
arrived the previous night at a village in Guinea, lost
in the midst of vast savage regions, that he was
farther than ever from home, in a place where even
letters would not reach him.</p>

<p>Quietly, so that he might not disturb Fatou and
the still sleeping spahis, he approached the open
window and gazed out at this new country.</p>

<p>He was overlooking a precipice some three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
feet deep. This hut that he was in seemed suspended
in the air above it. At his feet lay a landscape with
the characteristic features of the interior, as yet but
vaguely revealed in the pale light of dawn.</p>

<p>There were steep hills, covered with masses of
verdure, such as he had never seen before.</p>

<p>Below, right at the foot of the precipice, flowed
the river which had brought him thither, a long,
silver ribbon upon the mud, partly veiled by a white
cloud of morning mist. The crocodiles that lay on
the banks looked like small lizards, seen from such
a height. The air was filled with an unknown scent.</p>

<p>The exhausted rowers were sleeping down there,
where they had halted the previous night, lying in
their canoe upon their oars.</p>

<h3>XXVII</h3>

<p>There was a clear stream flowing over a bed of
dark pebbles, between walls of wet, polished rock.
Trees formed an arch above it; the landscape had a
freshness that one might have associated with any
other place rather than an obscure corner in the
heart of Africa.</p>

<p>Naked women, of the same reddish-brown colouring
as the rocks, their heads ornamented with amber,
were everywhere washing <i>pagnes</i>, and excitedly
recounting the events and combats of the night.
Warriors armed to the teeth were fording the stream
on their way to battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Jean took his first walk around the village, whither
his new fate had brought him for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p>There was certainly trouble brewing, and the little
post of Gadiangué foresaw a time when it would be
obliged to close its doors to allow the negro communities
time to settle their own affairs—as one
closes one’s windows during a passing shower.</p>

<p>But in all this there was movement, vitality,
originality even to excess. There were forests,
verdure, flowers, mountains, running water—awe-inspiring,
natural splendour.</p>

<p>There was no element of gloom in it, and it was all
new and strange.</p>

<p>From the distance comes the sound of the tom-tom,
the warlike music draws nearer, until it is close
at hand and deafeningly loud. The women at their
washing by the clear stream, and Jean himself,
raise their heads and look up into the blue space
framed in polished rock. An allied chief is passing
by overhead with his fighting men, scrambling with
monkey-like agility over the trunks of fallen trees.
He proceeds on his way with pomp, with music heading
the procession.... The arms and amulets of
the warriors in his train glitter in the sun, as they
file past with swift, light step, in the overwhelming
heat.</p>

<p>It is almost noon when Jean climbs back along the
green paths to the village.</p>

<p>The huts of Gadiangué are grouped together in the
shade of great trees. They are of a good height,
and have almost a certain elegance, with their high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
pitched roofs of thatch. Women are sleeping on
mats on the ground; others, seated on the verandahs,
are soothing small children with long-drawn lullabies.
And warriors, armed to the teeth, recount to one
another their exploits of the previous night as they
wipe their big iron knives.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>No. Certainly, there is no element of melancholy
in all this. The intensely hot air is terribly heavy,
but it has not the overwhelmingly depressing quality
of the air on the banks of the Senegal, and the vital,
equatorial sap circulates through everything.</p>

<p>Jean looks around him and feels alive. He is not
sorry now to have come. He has never imagined
anything to equal this.</p>

<p>Later, when he has returned to his home, he will
be glad that he has set foot in this distant region, and
he will look back on it with pleasure.</p>

<p>He regards this sojourn in the Ouankarah as a
spell of freedom spent in a wonderful hunting
country, clad with verdure and forests. It seems
to him a period of respite from the terribly monotonous
existence, the deadly routine of life in exile.</p>

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<p>Jean had a poor old silver watch by which he set
as much store as Fatou by her amulets—it was his
father’s watch, which the latter had given to him at
the moment of parting. This, and a medal, which
he wore on a chain round his neck, were his most
cherished possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The medal bore the Virgin’s effigy. Once when
he was ill his mother had laid it on his breast, and
though he was then but a tiny child, he remembered
the day when it had been placed there, and it had
never been removed. He was lying in his first little
cot, suffering from some childish ailment, the only
one that had ever attacked him. He had woken up
and had seen his mother weeping by his side; it was a
winter afternoon; through the window the snow was
visible, covering the mountain like a white cloak.
Gently raising his little head, his mother had hung
the medal round his neck. Then she had kissed him,
and he had gone to sleep again.</p>

<p>That was more than fifteen years ago. Since
then the dimensions of his neck and throat had
increased greatly, but the medal remained in its
place. He had never suffered so acute a pang as
one night, the first he had ever spent in a place of
ill-fame, when the hands of some girl had chanced
upon the sacred medal, and the miserable creature
had burst out laughing as she touched it....</p>

<p>As for the watch, it was some forty years since it
had been bought, secondhand, by his father, with
his first savings out of his soldier’s pay. Once upon
a time, apparently, it had been a very remarkable
watch, but now it was somewhat old-fashioned,
large and cumbrous, and it struck the hour in a way
that proclaimed its very venerable age.</p>

<p>His father still valued it highly. (Watches were
not very common possessions among the mountaineers
in his village.)</p>

<p>The watchmaker in a neighbouring market town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
who had repaired it before Jean went away on service,
had pronounced its works to be uncommonly
good, and his old father had entrusted this companion
of his youth to his care with all kinds of
recommendations.</p>

<p>At first Jean had worn it, but with the regiment,
whenever he looked at the time, he heard bursts of
laughter. The jokes made on the subject of this
“turnip” were so uncalled for that once or twice
Jean had turned quite red with rage and pain.</p>

<p>Rather than hear this watch disparaged he would
have suffered all kinds of insults to himself, and he
would have welcomed blows in the face that he could
have repaid in kind. It pained him all the more,
because privately he was obliged to admit to himself
that there was something a little ridiculous about this
poor, dear old watch. His affection for it increased;
it caused him inexpressible pain to see it thus held
up to derision, especially as he realised its oddity
himself.</p>

<p>Then he ceased to wear it, to save it from these
insults. He did not even wind it, so as to give its
works a rest, especially as the jolting it had suffered
on the voyage, and the great unaccustomed heat,
had caused it to indicate the most unlikely hours—in
fact to go entirely off the lines.</p>

<p>He had put it away tenderly in a box, where he
kept his most cherished possessions, his letters, his
little souvenirs of home. This box was a fetish box;
one of those absolutely sacred boxes such as sailors
always possess, and soldiers now and then.</p>

<p>Fatou had been formally forbidden to touch it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this watch attracted her. She had
discovered how to open the precious box. When
Jean was away, she had found out by herself how to
wind up the watch, how to move the hands and make
it strike. When she put it close to her ear she would
listen to the little cracked tones, with the inquisitive
air of an ouistiti which has found a musical box.</p>

<h3>XXIX</h3>

<p>At Gadiangué one never experienced a sensation
of coolness or physical well-being. Not even the
nights were fresh, as in the winter season in Senegal.</p>

<p>From morning onwards, the same oppressive,
deadly heat prevailed in the shade of that wonderful
verdure. From morning onwards, before sunrise,
at whatever hour, in whatever place, always, always,
the same temperature, the temperature of a vapour
bath, moist, overpowering, poisonous, pervading
these forests, the abode of chattering monkeys, green
parrots, and rare humming birds; these shady paths,
these tall dank grasses, where serpents glided. All
the heat and heaviness of the equatorial atmosphere
was concentrated during the night under the foliage
of the great trees; and everywhere the air was steeped
in deadly miasma.</p>

<p>As had been foreseen, at the end of three months,
the country was quiet. The war, the negro massacres
were over. The caravans resumed their journeys,
bringing to Gadiangué from the depths of Africa
gold, ivory, feathers, all the products of the Soudan
and the interior of Guinea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>And the order having been given to withdraw the
reinforcements, a ship was sent to wait for the spahis
at the mouth of the river to bring them back to
Senegal.</p>

<p>Alas, poor fellows! not all of them had survived.
Out of twelve that had fared forth, two failed to
obey the order of recall; two lay asleep in the hot
earth of Gadiangué, victims of fever.</p>

<p>But Jean’s hour had not yet come, and one day he
set out on his return journey along the route that
he had taken three months before in Samba-Boubou’s
canoe.</p>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<p>This time it was high noon; the spahis were
journeying in a Mandinga pirogue, shaded by a
moistened awning.</p>

<p>They kept close to the dense verdure of the banks,
gliding beneath branches and hanging roots of trees
for the sake of the scanty shade, warm and danger-haunted,
which these cast upon the river.</p>

<p>The water seemed stagnant and motionless, heavy
as oil, with wisps of fever-impregnated vapour hovering
here and there above its polished surface.</p>

<p>The sun was at its zenith; it darted down its perpendicular
light from a sky of violet grey, leaden
grey, dim with the miasma of the swamps.</p>

<p>The heat was so appalling that the black oarsmen,
in spite of all their pluck, were obliged to take a rest.
The tepid water could no longer quench their thirst;
they were exhausted, and seemed to be melting away
in perspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, when they halted, the pirogue, carried
gently along by an almost imperceptible current,
drifted onwards. The spahis could study at close
quarters a whole strange world, the underworld that
had its being beneath the mangroves and peopled all
the marshes of equatorial Africa.</p>

<p>In the shade, in the obscure network of great roots,
this world lay asleep.</p>

<p>There, two steps away from the canoe, which
glided past without a sound, stealing by so quietly
that not even the birds were awakened—near enough
to touch it—lay dull-green crocodiles, their sleek
forms stretched out on the mud, yawning and
grinning idiotically with gaping viscous jaws. There
were graceful white herons asleep likewise, snowy
white balls, standing on one leg, and to avoid contact
with the mud actually perched on the backs of
the crocodiles in their trance-like sleep. There were
kingfishers of every shade of green and blue taking
their noonday rest by the water’s edge, in the company
of sluggish lizards and great, wonderful butterflies
that had come to life in a temperature like a
boiler’s, slowly folding and unfolding their wings
wherever they happened to alight, resembling dead
leaves when their wings were closed, brilliant as
mysterious jewels when their wings were spread, all
glittering with blue enamel and metallic gleams.</p>

<p>Above all, there were roots of mangrove trees,
roots and still more roots, trailing down everywhere,
like sheaves of filaments; roots of all lengths and
thicknesses, falling in tangled masses from every
direction. You would have said thousands of nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
tentacles, grey arms, eager to enmesh and envelop
all things. Great stretches of country were covered
with these entanglements of roots. And swarming
all over the mud and the roots and the crocodiles
were colonies of great grey crabs, continually brandishing
their single pair of ivory white pincers, as if
seeking in dreams to clutch an imaginary prey. The
somnambulistic movement of all these crabs under
the dense verdure was the only sign of life perceptible
throughout this sleeping universe.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>When the black oarsmen had recovered their
breath, they resumed, in low voices, their wild singing,
and rowed furiously. Then the spahis’ pirogue
cut through the quiet waters of the Diakhallémé and
sped down the winding river, gliding very swiftly
through the heart of the forests.</p>

<p>As the canoe approached the sea, the hills and the
great trees that had characterised the interior disappeared.
Once more they were in the midst of the
vast plain, with its inextricable tangle of mangroves
covering it like a mantle of uniform green.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>The overpowering heat of noon was past, and some
birds were flying about. Nonetheless a perpetual
stillness possessed this region; beyond the reach of
sight there was the same monotony, the same trees,
the same calm.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen but a never varying
border of mangroves, recalling from a distance the
familiar aspect of poplars by our riversides in France.
To right and left, at intervals, there opened out new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
watercourses where the same silence brooded, watercourses
which vanished from sight in the remote
distance, ever bordered by these same curtains of
perpetual verdure. All Samba-Boubou’s wide
experience was needed to pilot the pirogue through
the labyrinth of these creeks.</p>

<p>No sound, no movement was perceptible, except,
now and then, the tremendous plunge of a hippopotamus,
who, disturbed by the measured cadences
of the oarsmen, disappeared, leaving great swirling
eddies on the mirror of the warm clouded waters.</p>

<p>For this reason Fatou, lying for greater safety in
the very bottom of the canoe, with a double screen of
leaves and wet cloths over her head, kept her eyes
tightly closed. This she did, because she had made
enquiries and knew what denizens one might expect
to see on these river banks.</p>

<p>When she arrived at Poupoubal, she had accomplished
the whole journey without having dared to
cast a single glance about her all the way. To
induce her to stir, Jean had to assure her very positively
that they had reached their destination, and
that, moreover, it was black night, and the danger,
therefore, at an end. She lay, quite benumbed, in
the bottom of the pirogue, and replied in the
querulous voice of a coaxing child. She wanted
Jean to take her in his arms and carry her himself
on board the ship from Goree, and this
he did.</p>

<p>These wiles were generally successful with the poor
spahi, who would yield at times and spoil Fatou,
simply because he felt the need of someone to pet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
someone to cherish, and Fatou was better than
nothing.</p>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<p>The Governor of Goree did not forget his promise
to the spahi Boyer; on his return Jean was posted
again to St Louis, there to complete his term of
exile.</p>

<p>Jean was conscious of a certain emotion as the
country of sand and the white town came into sight;
he had an affection for them, such as one always feels
for places where one has lived and endured a long
time. And then, in the first moments, he took a
kind of pleasure in revisiting what was almost a town,
almost civilisation, and resuming former habits and
friendships. It was only by virtue of his prolonged
deprivation of all these things that they acquired
the slightest importance in his eyes on his return to
them.</p>

<p>There is small demand for lodgings in Senegal.
Samba-Hamet’s house had no new occupants.
Coura n’diaye witnessed the return of Jean and
Fatou, and opened the door of their former dwelling
to them.</p>

<p>For the spahi, the days relapsed again into their
former monotonous routine.</p>

<h3>XXXII</h3>

<p>Nothing had changed in St Louis. In their quarter
the same tranquillity prevailed. The tame marabouts
that lived on their roof clacked their beaks, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
they sunned themselves, with the same sound of dry
wood, such as is made by the cogged wheels of a
windmill.</p>

<p>The negresses still pounded their everlasting
kouss-kouss. Everywhere the same familiar sounds,
the same monotonous stillness, the same calm of
prostrate nature.</p>

<p>But Jean was growing more and more weary of it
all.</p>

<p>Day by day he drew further away from Fatou;
he was utterly out of conceit with his black
mistress.</p>

<p>She had grown more exacting and also more
malicious, more especially since she had realised her
power over Jean—ever since he had stayed behind on
her account.</p>

<p>Scenes were frequent between them. At times
she would exasperate him from sheer perversity and
spitefulness.</p>

<p>Latterly he had acquired a habit of striking her
with his riding whip, not very hard at first, but as
time went on with increasing violence. His blows
sometimes left marks like parallel scorings on Fatou’s
bare back—black on black. Afterwards he would
be sorry and ashamed.</p>

<p>One day, as he was returning to his dwelling,
he had seen from a distance a Khassonké, a big,
black gorilla of a man, beating a hasty retreat
through the window.</p>

<p>On this occasion he did not so much as say one
word. After all, he was indifferent to anything that
she might do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>He had come to the end of any sentiment of pity,
or tenderness even, that at moments he might have
felt. He had had enough of her; he was tired of her;
disgusted with her. He kept her, simply because he
was too lazy to get rid of her.</p>

<p>He had entered upon his last year; everything
pointed to the end, to his departure. He began to
count the months.</p>

<p>Sleep had abandoned him, a common sequence to
a long sojourn in these enervating countries. At
night he would spend hours leaning on his elbow at
the window, breathing in with rapture the cool air
of his last winter season—and above all, dreaming
of his return.</p>

<p>The moon, in her quiet course over this desert
land, generally found him there at his window. He
loved these beautiful, tropic nights, the rosy glow
upon the sand; the trails of silver on the gloomy
waters of the river. Each night the wind wafted to
him from the plains of Sorr the distant cry of the
jackals—and even this doleful cry had come to be a
familiar sound.</p>

<p>When he reflected that soon he would be leaving
all this for ever, the thought seemed to cast a vague
gloom upon the joy of his return.</p>

<h3>XXXIII</h3>

<p>It was several days since Jean had opened his box
of treasures and looked at his old watch.</p>

<p>He was on duty in barracks, when he suddenly
thought of it with a feeling of uneasiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>He returned home, walking more rapidly than was
his wont, and on his arrival he opened his box.</p>

<p>His heart felt a sudden shock. The watch was
nowhere to be seen.... In feverish anxiety he
ransacked the contents of the box.... No, it was
no longer there!...</p>

<p>Fatou was humming a tune with an air of indifference,
watching him all the time out of the corner
of her eye. She was threading beads; arranging
colour effects for her necklaces; busy with great
preparations for the next day’s festivals, the bamboulas
of Tabaski, at which one had to look one’s
best.</p>

<p>“You have put it somewhere else? Quick,
Fatou, tell me.... I had forbidden you to touch
it. Where have you put it?...”</p>

<p>“<i>Ram!</i>” ... (I don’t know), answered Fatou
unconcernedly.</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out on Jean’s forehead, distracted
as he was with anxiety and rage. He took
Fatou by the arm and shook her roughly.</p>

<p>“Where have you put it?... Come, tell me at
once.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ram!</i>”</p>

<p>Suddenly a light dawned upon him. He had
caught sight of a new <i>pagne</i>, with a pink and blue
zig-zag pattern, carefully folded, hidden away in a
corner in readiness for the next day’s festivities....</p>

<p>He understood. Snatching up the pagne he unfolded
it and flung it on the ground.</p>

<p>“You have sold the watch,” he cried. “Come,
Fatou, be quick, tell me the truth.” ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He threw her on her knees on the floor in a furious
rage and seized his whip.</p>

<p>Fatou knew perfectly well that she had touched a
precious fetish, and that it was a serious matter.
But she possessed the audacity that comes of
impunity. She had already offended so many times,
and Jean had so many times forgiven her.</p>

<p>Yet she had never before seen Jean like this; she
uttered a cry; she was afraid. She began to kiss his
feet.</p>

<p>“Pardon, Tjean!... Pardon!”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>In such moments of fury Jean did not realise his
own strength. He was subject to these fits of almost
savage passion common to children who have grown
up in the woods. He rained blows upon Fatou’s
bare back, inflicting stripes from which the blood
gushed, and with the falling of the blows his rage
increased.</p>

<p>At length he grew ashamed of what he had done,
and throwing down the whip he cast himself on his
couch....</p>

<h3>XXXIV</h3>

<p>A moment later Jean was running towards the
market of Guet n’dar.</p>

<p>In the end Fatou had confessed, and had told him
the name of the merchant to whom she had sold the
watch. He had some hope of finding his poor old
watch still there, and of being able to buy it back;
he had just drawn his monthly pay, and this sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
money should be sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p>He walked very rapidly; he ran; he hastened to
reach the market, as if, while he was actually on his
way, some black purchaser were standing there
bargaining for the watch, and on the point of carrying
it off.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>On the sands at Guet n’dar tumult prevails. A
confused throng, composed of every type of negro,
is gathered together, uttering a babel of all the languages
of the Soudan. There, throughout the year,
is held a great market, crowded with people from all
parts of Africa, and every imaginable article is offered
for sale—precious things, absurd things, merchandise
useful and fantastic, the most incongruous wares,
gold and butter, meat and unguents, live sheep and
manuscripts, prisoners and porridge, amulets and
vegetables.</p>

<p>One side of the picture is framed by an arm of the
river, St Louis in the background, with its straight
lines, its Babylonian terraces, its white limewash
splashed with brick red, and here and there the yellow
crest of a palm tree, erect against the blue sky.</p>

<p>On the other side lies Guet n’dar, the negro ant
heaps, with its thousands of pointed roofs.</p>

<p>Close by caravans are halting, camels lying on the
sand, Moors unloading their bales of ground nuts and
their fetish pouches of wrought leather.</p>

<p>Pedlars of both sexes are crouched on the sand,
laughing and quarrelling, jostled and trodden upon,
they and their wares, by their customers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Hou! dièndé m’pât!</i>” ... (women selling
sour milk out of goatskins sewn together, with the
hair on the inner side).</p>

<p>“<i>Hou! dièndé nébam!</i>” (butter sellers—women
of the Peuhle tribe, with great, three-cornered
chignons, ornamented with copper discs—diving with
both hands for their merchandise into vessels of hairy
goatskin—rolling it between their fingers into little
grimy balls, sold at a halfpenny each—then wiping
their paws on their hair).</p>

<p>“<i>Hou! dièndé kheul!... dièndé khorompolé</i>”
(women selling simples, little bundles of enchanted
herbs, lizard tails, and roots with magic properties).</p>

<p>“<i>Hou! dièndé tchiakhkha!... dièndé djiareb!</i>” ...
(women squatting on the ground selling grains
of gold, fragments of jade, amber beads, silver
frontlets—all spread out on the ground on pieces of
dingy linen and trodden upon by the customers).</p>

<p>“<i>Hou! dièndé guerté!... dièndé khankhel!
dièndé jap-nior ...</i>” (women selling pistachios, live
ducks, absurd eatables, meat dried in the sun, sweet
pastes, devoured by flies).</p>

<p>Women selling salt fish, pipes, things of every
description; old jewels; old dirty verminous pagnes
robbed from the corpse; Galam butter, used for
frizzling the hair; little old tails of hair, cut or torn
from the heads of dead negresses, and plaited and
gummed ready for use just as they are.</p>

<p>Women selling grigris, amulets, old guns, gazelles’
dung, old copies of the Koran, annotated by pious
Marabouts of the desert; musk, flutes, old silver-handled
daggers, old iron knives that have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
been plunged into men’s vitals; tom-toms, giraffes’
horns, and old guitars.</p>

<p>Beggars and vagabonds, the dregs of negro
humanity, sit about under the gaunt, yellow cocoanut
palms; old leper women stretching out hands covered
with white ulcers for alms; old moribund skeletons,
their legs swollen with elephantiasis, with big fat flies
and maggots feeding on the open sores.</p>

<p>On the grounds ordure of all kinds.</p>

<p>And overhead, darting down its perpendicular
rays, burns one of those scorching suns that seem to
be almost on one’s head, the radiating heat roasting
one, like a brazier too close to one.</p>

<p>And always, always, the desert for horizon—the
infinite flatness of the desert.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>It was there, before the wares displayed by one
Bob-Bakary-Diam, that Jean halted with beating
heart. Hastily he cast anxious, scrutinising glances
upon the hugger-mugger of objects scattered about
in front of him.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, my white man,” said Bob-Bakary-Diam
in Yolof, with a quiet smile, “the watch that
strikes! Four days ago the girl came and sold it to
me for three silver <i>khâliss</i>. Very sorry, my white
man, but as it was a watch that struck, I sold it the
very same day to a Trarzas chief, who left with a
caravan for Timbuctoo.”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>All was over then! He must think no more of
the poor old watch. He was overwhelmed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
despair, heartbroken, as if he had lost someone
very dear to him, through his own fault.</p>

<p>If only he could have thrown himself into his
old father’s arms and asked his forgiveness, it
would have been some comfort. Had the watch but
fallen into the sea, or into the river, or in some corner
of the desert! But to have it thus sold and profaned
by that miserable Fatou! It was beyond endurance.
He could have wept, almost, if his heart had not
been too full of rage against the creature.</p>

<p>It was this Fatou who for four years had wasted
his money, his dignity, his very life. In order to
keep her he had sacrificed promotion; for her sake
he had remained in Africa—for the sake of this ill-natured,
perverse little creature, black of face and
black of soul, all strung about with charms and
amulets.</p>

<p>He worked himself up, as he strode along in the
sun; her spells inspired him with a kind of superstitious
horror, while her spitefulness and impudence,
the audacity of her last exploit, roused him to frantic
rage.</p>

<p>He returned home, walking rapidly, his blood
boiling, his head burning, grief and anger seething
within him.</p>

<h3>XXXV</h3>

<p>Fatou was awaiting his return in great anxiety. As
soon as he entered she saw that he had not recovered
his treasure—the old watch that struck the hour.</p>

<p>His aspect was so sombre that she thought he was
probably going to kill her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>This she could understand. For if any one had
taken from her a certain shrivelled amulet, the most
precious one that she possessed, given her by her
mother when she was a small child in Galam—she,
too, would have thrown herself upon the thief and
killed him if she could.</p>

<p>She fully realised that she had done something
very terrible, driven to it by evil spirits, through her
besetting sin, her inordinate love of finery. She
knew perfectly well that she had been very wicked.
She was sorry to have caused Jean so much pain;
she would not mind if he killed her—but she would
have liked to kiss him.</p>

<p>She was almost glad, now, when Jean beat her,
because it was only on such occasions that he ever
touched her and that she could touch him, pressing
herself close to him as she pleaded for mercy. This
time, when he should seize her in order to kill her,
when she had nothing more to risk, she would gather
all her strength and cling to him, striving to reach
his lips. She would clasp him in her embrace until
she was dead—and death was a thing of very little
account to her.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>If Jean could have interpreted all that was passing
in that little gloomy heart, doubtless, to his sorrow,
he would have forgiven her yet again, for it was
never difficult to mollify him.</p>

<p>But Fatou did not speak, because she was conscious
that nothing of all this could be expressed; moreover,
the idea of this supreme struggle, wherein she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
clasp him and embrace him and die at his hands, thus
ending everything—the idea of this had a charm for
her. She waited for him, fixing her great, lustrous
eyes upon him, with an expression of mingled
passion and terror.</p>

<p>But Jean had entered without one word, without
one glance at her, and then she no longer understood.</p>

<p>He had even thrown away his whip as he entered,
ashamed of the brutality he had shown towards a
girl, and loath to repeat it.</p>

<p>He merely set to work to tear down all the amulets
that were hanging on the walls, and to fling them out
of the window.</p>

<p>Then he seized <i>pagnes</i>, necklaces, <i>bou-bous</i>, calabashes,
and, still without a word, he threw them out
on to the sand.</p>

<p>And Fatou began to realise what was in prospect;
she divined that all was over, and was appalled at
the thought.</p>

<p>When all her possessions were thrown out of the
window and scattered about the square, Jean showed
her the door, saying through his clenched white teeth,
in a sullen voice that admitted of no reply, the one
word, “Go!”</p>

<p>And Fatou went, with hanging head, without a
word. No, she had never conceived a fate so terrible
as to be thus driven away. She felt as if she would
go mad—and she went, without daring to raise her
head, powerless to utter a cry, say a word, or shed a
tear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXXVI</h3>

<p>Then Jean calmly began to put together all his
own possessions, folding his clothes neatly as if he
were preparing his kit bag. He packed carefully,
having acquired unconsciously a habit of orderliness
with the regiment. At the same time he hurried
over the task, for fear lest he should be seized with
regret, and waver in his resolve.</p>

<p>He found some small consolation in this terrible
act of vengeance, this satisfaction afforded to the
memory of the old watch. He was glad to have had
sufficient resolution, and he told himself that soon he
would be able to throw himself into his father’s arms—confessing
all, and obtaining his forgiveness.</p>

<p>When he had finished he went down to Coura
n’diaye, the woman <i>griot</i>. He saw Fatou, who had
taken refuge there, cowering motionless in a corner.
The little slave girls had gathered up her possessions
from out-of-doors, and had placed them in calabashes
by her side.</p>

<p>Jean would not so much as look at her. He
approached Coura n’diaye, paid his month’s rent,
and told her that he was not coming back. Then he
threw his light baggage on his back and took his
departure.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Poor old watch! His father had said to him,
“Jean, it is rather old, but it’s a very good watch;
they don’t make such good watches nowadays. Later
on, when you are rich, you can buy a new-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
one, if you like, but then give me this one back
again. I have kept it for forty years; I had it when
I was with the regiment. When I am buried, if
you no longer need it, do not forget to place it in my
coffin. It will be company for me, where I am
going.”</p>

<p>Coura had taken the spahi’s money without offering
any comments on his sudden departure, with the
indifference of an old courtesan who has outlived all
interest in life.</p>

<p>When Jean left the house he called his Laobé dog,
who followed him, his ears flat, as if he had grasped
the situation and were sorry to go. Then, without
turning his head, Jean went his way through the long
streets of the dead-alive town in the direction of the
barracks.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="PART_III">PART III</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>After Jean had thus rid himself of Fatou-gaye, he
was conscious of a deep feeling of relief at having
carried out this act of vengeance. When he had
neatly arranged in his soldier’s wardrobe the small
quantity of baggage he had brought with him from
Samba-Hamet’s house, he felt freer and happier.
He seemed to have advanced a step nearer to his
departure, to that blissful, “final discharge” which
was now only a few months away.</p>

<p>At the same time he was sorry for Fatou. He had
intended to send her his pay once more, to enable her
either to set up house anew or to leave the town.</p>

<p>But as he preferred not to see her again, he had
entrusted the spahi Muller with this errand.</p>

<p>Muller had visited Samba-Hamet’s house and had
seen the woman griot. But Fatou had gone.</p>

<p>“She was in great trouble,” said the little slave
girls in Yolof, forming a circle round him and all
talking at once. “In the evening she would not
eat the <i>kouss-kouss</i> we had made for her.”</p>

<p>“During the night,” said little Sam-Lélé, “I
heard her talking aloud in her sleep, and even the
Laobé dogs yapped, which is a very bad sign. But
I could not understand what she was saying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>She had undoubtedly gone away a little before sunrise,
with her calabashes on her head.</p>

<p>A macauco woman, Bafoufalé-Diop by name, the
woman griot’s chief slave, a person of a very inquisitive
disposition, had followed her from a distance, and
had seen her turn off by the wooden bridge, over the
narrow arm of the river, in the direction of N’dar-toute.</p>

<p>“She had the look of knowing quite well where
she was going.”</p>

<p>It was thought in the quarter that she must have
sought a refuge in the house of a certain old and
very rich Marabout in N’dar-toute, who admired her
greatly. Christian or not, she was good-looking
enough to be free from all anxiety as to her future.</p>

<p>For some time to come Jean avoided passing
Coura n’diaye’s dwelling, and it was not long before
he had dismissed the matter entirely from his
thoughts.</p>

<p>It seemed to him, moreover, as if he had recovered
his white man’s dignity, which had been sullied
through contact with that black flesh.</p>

<p>Now, when he looked back, that feverishness of
senses, abnormally excited by the African climate,
inspired in him nothing but deep disgust. And he
constructed for himself a new scheme of existence,
based upon continence and integrity.</p>

<p>In future he meant to live in barracks, like a
sensible man. He would save money in order to
take back to Jeanne Méry a collection of souvenirs
from Senegal—fine mats, which would some day
adorn their home, the subject of his dreams; embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<i>pagnes</i>, whose rich colours would evoke
the admiration of his countrymen, and which would
serve for splendid tablecloths in their household; and
above all, earrings and a cross in fine Galam gold,
which he would order especially for her from the
most skilful native craftsmen. She would wear
them for ornament on Sunday when she went to
church with the Peyrals, and certainly no other
young woman in the village would possess such
beautiful jewellery.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>This tall spahi, poor fellow, who had so grave an
air, was nursing in his uncultured brain a multitude
of almost childish projects, simple dreams of happiness,
of family life and tranquil goodness.</p>

<p>At this time, Jean was nearly twenty-six. He
looked older than his years, as is usual with men who
have led a hard life in the fields, on the sea, or in the
army.</p>

<p>He had changed greatly during these five years in
Senegal.</p>

<p>His features were more pronounced; he was
swarthier and thinner, and had acquired a more
soldierly bearing and more of the Arab look. His
shoulders had expanded, while his waist had remained
slender and supple. His manner of wearing his
fez and turning up the ends of his long moustache had
a soldierly smartness, which became him to admiration.
His strength and remarkable physical beauty
inspired in all who came in contact with him a kind of
involuntary respect. They distinguished between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
him and his comrades in the manner in which they
spoke to him.</p>

<p>A painter might have selected him for a consummate
type of noble charm and manly perfection.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>One day Jean received two letters in a single
envelope, bearing the postmark of his village. One
letter was from his dear old mother, the other from
Jeanne.</p>

<p>Letter from Françoise Peyral to her son.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My dear son,—Since my last letter many things have
happened which will surprise you very much. But do
not worry about them yet. You must do as we do, pray
to the good God, and hope for the best.</p>

<p>I will begin by telling you that a new attorney has
come into these parts, a young man called M. Prosper
Suirot, who is not very much liked with us, being hard on
poor people, and underhand by nature. But he is a man
with a fine position, that cannot be denied. Well, this
M. Suirot has asked your Uncle Méry for Jeanne’s hand
in marriage, and has been accepted as his son-in-law.
Now Méry came here one evening and made a scene; he
had applied to your colonels for information about you
without telling us, and it appears that he received bad
accounts of you. They said that you were living with a
negro woman out there; that you kept her, in spite of
the remonstrances of your commanding officers, and that
it was this that prevented you from becoming quartermaster,
that there are bad reports of you out there;
many things, my dear son, that I could never have
believed, but it was written on a piece of stamped paper,
with your regimental crest on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Jeanne came running to us in tears, vowing that
she would never marry Suirot, or be wife to any one but
you, my dear Jean, and that she would rather go into a
convent.</p>

<p>I enclose a letter which she has written to you, in
which she lets you know what you ought to do. She is
of age, and very level-headed. Do exactly as she tells
you, and write by return of post to your uncle, as she
bids you. You will come back to us in ten months’ time,
my dear son. If you behave well till you obtain your
discharge, and pray constantly to the good God, without
doubt everything will come right. But we are much
worried, as you may imagine. We are afraid, too, that
Méry may forbid Jeanne to come and see us again, and
that will be a great pity.</p>

<p>Peyral joins me, my dear son, in embracing you, and
in begging you to write to us as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Your old mother, who will love you as long as she lives.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Françoise Peyral.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Jeanne Méry to her cousin Jean.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My dear Jean,—I am so unhappy that I wish I could
die on the spot. It is a great grief to me that you have
never returned, and that you do not talk of coming back
soon. And now my parents, backed up by my godfather,
want to marry me to that horrid Suirot, of whom I have
told you. People din into my ears that he is rich, and
that I ought to feel honoured because he has made me an
offer. I say no, you may be sure, and I am crying my
eyes out.</p>

<p>My dear Jean, I am very unhappy, because everyone
is against me. Olivette and Rose laugh when they see
me always with red eyes; I think they would be very
glad to marry that big booby Suirot, if he would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
have them. As for me, the mere thought of it makes me
shudder; and I will positively never marry him. If they
drive me to it, I will run away from them all, and go into
the convent of St Bruno.</p>

<p>If only I could sometimes pay your people a visit, it
would cheer me up to have a talk with your mother,
whom I love and respect as if I were her daughter. But
as it is, I am given black looks, because I go there too
often, and who knows if I shall not soon be forbidden
to go at all.</p>

<p>My dear Jean, you must do exactly what I am going
to tell you. I hear there are wicked rumours about you;
I say to myself that people spread them for the sole purpose
of influencing me. But I do not believe one word
of all these stories. They are impossible, and no one here
knows you as well as I do. All the same, I should be
happy if you would say one little word on this subject,
and if you would tell me of your affection for me; you
know that it is always pleasant to hear about it, even if
one is sure of it. And then, write to my father immediately
and ask for my hand in marriage, and be sure
to promise him that when you are home and my husband,
you will always behave like a sensible, steady man,
against whom nothing can be said. And then I will beg
him on my knees.</p>

<p>The good God pity us, my dear Jean!</p>

<p class="center">Your betrothed for life,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jeanne Méry</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>In country places young people are not taught
to express in any way the sentiments of the heart.
Girls brought up on the land sometimes feel very
deeply, but they have no words to utter their
emotions and thoughts; the subtle diction of passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
is unknown to them. They cannot explain their
feelings, save by the help of simple unimpassioned
phrases. Therein lies the whole difference.</p>

<p>Jeanne must have felt very keenly to have written
such a letter, and Jean, who spoke the same, simple
language, recognised all the firmness and love that
underlay it. The fervent loyalty of his betrothed
inspired him with confidence and hope; he put into
his reply all the tenderness and gratitude that he
was able to express. He addressed to his Uncle
Méry a formal request for Jeanne’s hand, accompanied
by very sincere promises of steadiness and
good conduct, and then he awaited, without undue
anxiety, the return mail from France....</p>

<p>M. Prosper Suirot was a young attorney, narrow-chested
and round-shouldered; moreover, a rabid
free-thinker, bespattering with atheistic nonsense all
the holy things of old; a short-sighted scribbler,
whose small, red eyes were protected by smoked
glasses. This rival would have appeared an object
of pity to Jean, who felt an instinctive repugnance
for persons who were plain and of poor
physique.</p>

<p>Attracted by Jeanne’s dowry and beauty, the little
attorney imagined in his foolish conceit that he was
doing the peasant girl an honour by the offer of his
ugly person and infinitesimal social position. He
had even made up his mind that after their marriage,
in order to rise to his height, Jeanne, having become
a lady, should wear a hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Six months had passed. The mails from France
had brought poor Jean no very bad news, certainly,
but on the other hand none that were very good.</p>

<p>Uncle Méry remained inflexible, but Jeanne no
less so, and she always slipped into old Françoise’s
letter a few loyal and loving words to her betrothed.</p>

<p>Jean himself was full of hope, and never doubted
but that everything would be settled without difficulty
as soon as he arrived home.</p>

<p>He lost himself more and more in delicious
imaginings.... After these five years of exile his
return to the village glowed with all the colours of an
apotheosis. All the dreams of the poor, forlorn soldier
centred around that radiant moment. He would
take his seat in the village diligence, wearing the big
burnoose of his spahi’s uniform, and watch the
Cevennes coming into sight once more, the familiar
skyline of his mountains, the well-known road, the
dear old clock-tower, and at last his father’s cottage
by the roadside. With what rapture would he
embrace his beloved old parents!</p>

<p>Then the three of them would go together to see
the Mérys. The good people of the village, all the
girls, would come running out of their houses to
watch him go past. They would admire him in his
foreign dress, with the glamour of Africa upon him.
He would show Uncle Méry his quartermaster’s
stripes, which had at last been awarded him, and they
would have an irresistible effect. After all, Uncle
Méry was kind. True, he had often scolded Jean in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
former days, but he had been fond of him, too; Jean
had a very plain recollection of this now; he was
very sure of it. (To the exile, far away, those who
remain at home are always painted in softer colours;
they are remembered as affectionate and kind; their
defects, their hardness and rancour, are forgotten.)</p>

<p>And so it seemed impossible that Uncle Méry
should not suffer himself to be moved when he saw
his two children pleading together. He would surely
relent and place Jeanne’s trembling hand in Jean’s.
And then, what happiness, what a life of joy and
peace, what a Paradise on earth!...</p>

<p>At the same time, Jean did not find it so easy to
picture himself in the dress worn by the men of his
village. Especially he baulked at the unpretentious
headgear of a peasant. This transformation was a
subject on which he did not care to dwell. It seemed
to him that he would no longer, by himself, be the
proud spahi he had been, in the accoutrements of
former days.</p>

<p>It was in this red uniform that he had learnt to
know life. It was on African soil that he had become
a man, and more of a man than he guessed. He had
an affection for all this—for his Arab fez, his sabre,
his horse—this vast, God-forsaken country, this
desert of his.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Jean did not know what disillusion sometimes
awaits young men—sailors, soldiers, spahis—when
they return to the village which has so often inspired
their dreams—left when they were children, and
beheld from afar through magic prisms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas! what sadness, what dreary monotony, often
awaits these exiles on their return home.</p>

<p>Other unfortunate spahis, like himself acclimatised
and enervated in this land of Africa, have sometimes
regretted the desolate banks of the Senegal. The
long expeditions on horseback, the freer life, the
larger light, the boundless horizon—all these things
are missed when, having grown accustomed to them,
one is cut off from them. In the quiet of home life
one feels as it were a craving for the devouring sun,
the never-ending heat, a yearning for the desert, and
a home sickness for the sand.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In the meanwhile, Boubakar-Ségou, the great
negro chief, was making trouble in Diambour and
the country of Djiargabar. A rumour of an expedition
was in the air; it was discussed at St Louis in
the officers’ mess; debated and commented upon in
a thousand aspects by the soldiers, spahis, riflemen,
and marines. It was the talk of the day, and every
man had his hope of distinguishing himself, of gaining
some advantage, a medal or a step.</p>

<p>Jean, who was approaching the end of his service,
resolved to avail himself of this opportunity to make
amends for whatever might have been reprehensible
in his past behaviour. He dreamed of fastening in
his buttonhole the yellow ribbon of the Military
Medal, the reward of valour. He longed to signalise
his eternal farewell to the black country by some
splendid deed of bravery which would immortalise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
his name in the spahis’ barracks in that corner of the
world, where he had lived and suffered so intensely.</p>

<p>Each day there was a rapid interchange of correspondence
between the barracks, the naval authorities,
and Government. Large sealed covers were
delivered at the spahis’ quarters, giving the red
jackets food for thought. A long and important
expedition was anticipated, and the moment was
drawing near. The spahis sharpened their great
fighting swords, and furbished up their accoutrements
with much talk and bravado, much drinking
of absinthe, and a great flow of cheerful comment.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It was the beginning of October. Jean, who had
been on duty since early morning, going from place
to place distributing official documents right and
left, was on his way to Government House with a
large official envelope to deliver as his final charge.</p>

<p>In the long straight street, empty and deserted as
a street of Thebes or Memphis, he saw another man
in red coming towards him in the sunshine, holding
up a letter for him to see. He felt a mournful presentiment,
a vague foreboding, and he hastened his
step.</p>

<p>It was Sergeant Muller bringing the spahis the
French mail, which had arrived from Dakar by
caravan an hour ago.</p>

<p>“Here, Peyral, this is for you,” he said, handing
Jean an envelope bearing the postmark of the humble
village he loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>This letter, which Jean had been expecting for a
month, burned in his hands, and he hesitated to read
it. He resolved to wait until he had completed his
errand before opening it.</p>

<p>He arrived at the railing surrounding Government
House; the gate was open, and he entered.</p>

<p>The garden displayed the same lack of animation
as the street. A large tame lioness was stretching
herself in the sun with the airs of an amorous cat.
Ostriches were sleeping on the ground near some
stiff, bluish aloes. It was noon—not a soul visible—a
silence like that of a necropolis. Yellow palm trees
cast never-wavering shadows upon the great, white
terraces.</p>

<p>Jean, in his search for someone to speak to, reached
the office of the Governor himself, whom he found
surrounded by the heads of the various departments
of the colonial service.</p>

<p>There, strange to say, they were working
strenuously. Serious matters seemed to be under
discussion at this hour traditionally consecrated to
the repose of the siesta.</p>

<p>In exchange for the cover he delivered, Jean
received another addressed to the spahis’ commanding
officer.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>It contained definite marching orders, which were
communicated officially that afternoon, to all the
troops in St Louis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>When Jean found himself once more in the
deserted street he could restrain himself no longer,
and with trembling hands he opened the envelope.</p>

<p>This time it contained only his mother’s handwriting—handwriting
that was shakier than usual,
and stained with tears.</p>

<p>He devoured the lines—dizziness seized him, poor
fellow—clasping his head in his hands, he leaned
against the wall.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>The packet entrusted to him was very urgent, the
Governor had said. He kissed old Françoise’s name
piously, and went on his way like a drunken man.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Was this thing possible? It was over, over for
ever. They had taken from him, the poor exile,
the betrothed of his childish days, whom his old
parents had chosen for him.</p>

<p>“The banns are published. The marriage will
take place before the month is over. I had been fearing
this, my dear son, even since last month; for
Jeanne no longer came to see us. But I did not
dare to tell you just then for fear of distressing you,
since there was nothing that we could do in the
matter.</p>

<p>“We are in deep despair. Now, my son, a
thought struck Peyral yesterday which has alarmed
us; it is that you may not wish to come home again
now, but to remain in Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are both very old. My good Jean, my dear
son, your poor mother begs you on her knees not to
let this prevent you from being sensible and from
coming back to us soon, as we had expected. Otherwise
I would rather die at once, and Peyral too.”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Incoherent, tumultuous thoughts rushed through
Jean’s brain.</p>

<p>He made a rapid calculation of dates. No! It
was not all over yet, it was not yet an accomplished
fact. Telegraph! No! What possessed him?
There was no telegraphic communication between
France and Senegal. And after all, what could he
have said? If he could have gone away, leaving
everything behind, gone away on some very swift
ship, and still have arrived in time, he might have
thrown himself at their feet, with supplications and
tears, and have yet succeeded in moving them to
relent. But so far away! What futility! What
impotence! All would be consummated before he
could even reach them with his message of grief.</p>

<p>And he felt as if his head were crushed by iron
hands, and his breast in the grip of a remorseless
vice.</p>

<p>He halted again and reread the letter, and then
remembering that he was the bearer of urgent orders
from the Governor, he folded up the letter and
went on.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Around him all things were lapped in the profound
stillness of noon. The old Moorish houses stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
ranged in straight rows, milk-white beneath the
intense blue of the sky. At times, behind their
brick walls, the ear of the passer-by might catch some
negress’s plaintive, drowsy song, or perhaps the eye
might light on a small, coal-black negro asleep on a
doorstep, lying on his back in the sun, quite naked,
with a necklet of coral, forming a dark patch in the
midst of universal radiance. On the smooth sand of
the streets, the lizards were chasing one another
with curious little swaying movements of the head,
drawing their tails along the ground and tracing an
infinity of fantastic zig-zags, complicated like an
Arabic design. A distant noise of <i>kouss-kouss</i>
pounders, in its monotonous regularity almost a form
of silence, came from Guet n’dar, deadened by the
hot, heavy strata of the noontide atmosphere.</p>

<p>It seemed as if this tranquillity of prostrate nature
were seeking to make mock of poor Jean’s emotion,
and to intensify his sufferings. It oppressed him like
a leaden winding sheet.</p>

<p>Of a sudden this country appeared to him as a
vast tomb.</p>

<p>The spahi awoke as if from a heavy sleep that had
lasted five years.</p>

<p>He felt himself in fierce revolt, revolt against
everything and everyone. Why had they taken
him from his village, from his mother, to bury him,
in the prime of life, in this country of death?</p>

<p>By what right had they made of him that
anomalous being called a spahi, a swashbuckler, half
African, an outcast, forgotten of everyone, and at
last disowned even by his betrothed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt his heart possessed with frantic rage; he
was conscious of a desire to wreak his wrath on some
person or some object; a desire to torture, to seize,
to crush in his mighty arms a fellow man.</p>

<p>And all around him there was nothing, nothing but
silence, and heat, and sand.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Alas! he had not even one friend in this whole
country, not one devoted comrade to whom he could
confide his sorrow. Good God! he was indeed forsaken,
indeed alone in the world.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Jean hastened to the barracks and threw the packet
entrusted to him to the first person he met. Then
he turned away and set off haphazard for a rapid,
aimless walk—it was his own method of stifling his
sorrow.</p>

<p>He passed the bridge leading to Guet n’dar and
turned southwards in the direction of the Point of
Barbary, just as he had done that night four
years ago when he had fled from Cora’s house in
despair....</p>

<p>But this time his despair was the deep, supreme
despair of a man ... and his life was wrecked....</p>

<p>For a long time he went southwards, losing sight
of St Louis and the negro villages. He sat down
exhausted at the foot of a sandy mound overlooking
the sea....</p>

<p>His ideas had no sequence. The day’s excessive
sunshine had disordered his mind....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>He noticed that he had never been in this place
before, and he began to glance absently about him.</p>

<p>The whole mound bristled with tall posts of a
grotesque appearance, bearing inscriptions in the
language of the priests of Mahgreb. Bleached bones
lay strewn pell-mell upon the ground, unearthed
long ago by jackals. There were likewise a few
sprays of greenery, lost, as it were, in the midst of
absolute aridity. These were garlands of convolvulus,
exquisitely fresh, opening here and there
their large pink calyces, trailing among old skulls,
old arm and leg bones.</p>

<p>At intervals other funereal mounds of grim aspect
rose above the level plain.</p>

<p>Great flocks of pelicans, their white feathers tinged
with pink, were stalking about the beaches. Seen in
the distance through the evening mirage, their forms
assumed weird and unnatural proportions....</p>

<p>Evening had come. The sun had sunk down into
the ocean, and a cooler breeze had set in from the sea.</p>

<p>Jean took out his mother’s letter and began to read
it again....</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>“Now, my son, a thought struck Peyral yesterday
which has alarmed us. It is that you may not wish to
come back again now, but to remain in Africa.</p>

<p>“We are both very old. My good Jean, my dear
son, your poor mother begs you on her knees not to
let this prevent you from being sensible and from
coming back to us soon, as we had expected. Otherwise
I would rather die at once, and Peyral too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Then poor Jean felt his heart break—sobs rent his
bosom, and his spirit of revolt dissolved in tears.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Two days later all the warships required for the
expedition were assembled to the north of St Louis,
in the bend of the river near Pop-n’kior.</p>

<p>The embarkation was carried out in the midst of a
great throng of people and a tremendous hubbub.
All the women and children of the black riflemen
were massed on the banks, screaming to heaven, as
if bereft of reason.</p>

<p>Moors who had come by caravan from the interior
of the Soudan stood round in circles looking on,
with their camels, leather sacks, piles of miscellaneous
baggage, and their pretty young wives.</p>

<p>Towards three o’clock the whole flotilla, which was
to proceed up the river as far as Dialdé in Galam,
was groaning under its freight of men. It got under
way in appalling heat.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>St Louis was receding into the distance.... Its
level outlines sank lower, fading away until they
were mere bluish streaks upon the golden sand....
On either side of the river, stretching away until
lost to sight, lay vast, unhealthy desert plains, everlastingly
hot, everlastingly dreary....</p>

<p>And these tracts were but the approach to this
great God-forsaken country—the vestibule of the
immense solitudes of Africa....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean and the other spahis were embarked on the
Falémé, which led the flotilla, and was presently a
two days’ voyage ahead of the other vessels.</p>

<p>In the very moment of departure Jean had written
a hurried reply to poor old Françoise. After consideration,
he had decided that he would not deign
to write to his betrothed, but in his letter to his
mother he had put his whole soul into the task of
comforting her, and restoring peace and hope to her
mind.</p>

<p>“After all,” he had written, “she was too rich
for us. We shall have no difficulty in finding some
other girl at home who will have me. We will
arrange to live in our old house, and then we shall
be nearer to you than ever. My dear parents, I
think of nothing all day long but the joy of seeing you
once more, and I swear that I will never, never leave
you again....”</p>

<p>Such, to be sure, was his intention, and it was true
that he thought of his dear old parents every day.
But the idea of sharing his life with a woman other
than Jeanne took the brightness out of everything.
It was a terrible thought, which cast a dense, mourning
veil upon the joy of his return....</p>

<p>Do what he would to regain his courage, it seemed
that he had no longer an object in life, and that the
future was a blank wall to him for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Beside him on the bridge of the Falémé was seated
the gigantic Nyaor-fall, the black spahi, to whom, as
his most faithful friend, Jean had confided his
troubles.</p>

<p>Nyaor did not attempt to understand these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
sentiments—Nyaor, whom no one had ever loved, whose
thatched roof harboured three purchased wives,
whom he intended to sell as soon as they ceased to
please him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he realised that his friend Jean was
unhappy. He smiled at him kindly, and to distract
him told him negro stories irresistibly soporific.</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The flotilla sailed up the river with all possible
speed, making fast at sunset and getting under way
again at dawn.</p>

<p>At Richard-Toll, the first French outpost, more
men, negresses, and material were taken on board.</p>

<p>At Dagana, a two days halt was made, and the
Falémé received orders to continue her voyage alone
as far as Podor, the last outpost before reaching
Galam, where several companies of riflemen had
already been concentrated.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>The Falémé continued on her way through the
vast desert; she plunged swiftly into the interior,
sailing up the yellow waters of the narrow river
which separates Moorish Sahara from the great
mysterious continent with its black population.</p>

<p>Jean, in melancholy mood, saw one desolate region
succeeding another. His eyes followed the ever-receding
horizon—the winding ribbon of the Senegal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
lost in the infinite distance that lay behind him.
These accursed plains, unfolding themselves endlessly
before his gaze, made a painful impression upon him.
He felt a tightening of the heart, as if all the time
this whole country were closing in upon him, and he
were never to return.</p>

<p>Here and there on the desolate banks great, black
vultures stalked solemnly, or bald-headed marabouts,
with a suggestion of something human in their profiles.</p>

<p>Sometimes an inquisitive monkey would spring out
from the mangrove thicket to watch the ship glide
past—or a splendid white heron would rise from the
reeds, or a kingfisher in its sheen of emerald and
lapis lazuli, disturbing in its flight a sluggish crocodile
asleep on the mud.</p>

<p>On the south bank—the bank pertaining to the
sons of Ham—an occasional village would appear,
lost in the midst of this vast region of desolation.</p>

<p>The existence of these human habitations were
advertised from a great distance by two or three
gigantic palm trees, with fan-shaped leaves, huge
fetish trees, as it were, keeping watch over the towns.</p>

<p>In the midst of the great bare plain, these palm
trees had the appearance of giants lying in wait in
the desert. Their perfectly straight, highly polished,
greyish pink trunks were thickened like Byzantine
columns, and displayed at the top scanty bunches of
leaves, as stiff as if cut from iron plate.</p>

<p>Presently, as one drew nearer, one could discern
a negro anthill, huts with peaked roofs, grouped in
compact masses at the foot of the palm trees, producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a general effect of greyness against the unvarying
yellow of the sands.</p>

<p>Some of these African cities had a large population;
all were surrounded by thick, gloomy <i>tatas</i>—walls
made of earth and wood, and erected as a protection
against enemies and wild beasts. A tattered
piece of white cloth, floating from a roof loftier than
the rest, marked the dwelling of the chief.</p>

<p>At the gates of their ramparts sombre figures
showed themselves, aged chiefs, aged priests covered
with amulets, their long, black arms contrasting with
the whiteness of their flowing robes. They watched
the Falémé pass, her rifles and guns ready to open fire
at the slightest sign of hostile intention.</p>

<p>One might well ask what means of subsistence
these men possessed, what lives they led, what occupations
they pursued behind those grey walls—these
beings who knew nothing of the outer world, nothing
beyond the solitudes and the merciless sun.</p>

<p>On the north bank—where the Sahara lies—there
was more sand, more desolation, but of a different
aspect.</p>

<p>In the distance, very far away, shone out great
fires of grass kindled by the Moors, with columns of
smoke rising straight up in the still air to an incredible
height. On the horizon, chains of hills showed
up, intensely red, like burning coals, resembling,
amid these columns of smoke, an unlimited succession
of furnaces.</p>

<p>And there, where there was nothing but arid
ground and scorching sand, a perpetual mirage produced
the semblance of great lakes, wherein the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
whole conflagration was reflected and reversed.
Little wisps of quivering vapour, such as rise from a
furnace, wove above all this a shifting web. The
delusive landscapes shimmered and vibrated in the
intense heat, and then could be seen changing shape
and dissolving like visions. The eyes were dazzled
and wearied by the sight of them.</p>

<p>From time to time on this bank appeared groups
of men of pure white race—wild-looking and bronzed
indeed, but with features of regular beauty, and with
long curling hair, which gave them a look of Biblical
prophets. They went bare-headed under that
terrible sun, arrayed in flowing robes of dark blue.
These were Moors of the tribe of Braknas or Tzarzas,
bandits to a man, plunderers, robbers of caravans—the
most lawless of all the tribes of Africa.</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>The east wind, which is like the mighty respiration
of the Sahara, had sprung up, gaining strength by
degrees as the distance from the sea increased.</p>

<p>This parching wind, hot like a blast from a forge,
now blew across the desert. It covered all things
with a fine sandy dust, and brought with it the burning
thirst of <i>Bled-el-Ateuch</i>. The awnings that
sheltered the spahis had to be continually watered by
a negro, whose hosepipe traced rapid arabesques
which disappeared as quickly as they were made,
evaporating almost immediately in the parched
atmosphere.</p>

<p>And now the ship was approaching Podor, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the largest towns on the river, and the Sahara bank
began to show signs of life.</p>

<p>This was the entrance to the country of the
Douaïch, shepherds grown rich through cattle raids
upon the negro territory.</p>

<p>These Moors used to swim their long caravans
across the Senegal, driving before them the stolen
cattle. Presently camps came into view, pitched
upon the never-ending plain. The camelskin tents,
stretched between wooden stakes, resembled huge
bats’ wings spread out upon the sand; they formed
weird patterns of an intense black in the midst of a
country that was of a uniform, unvarying yellow.
Everywhere there were somewhat increased signs of
animation, of activity and life.</p>

<p>On the banks larger groups of people came
running to see the ship. Moorish women, beautiful,
copper-coloured creatures, half dressed, with frontlets
of coral, trotted up, sitting astride their small,
hump-backed cows; and often there were children
scampering along behind them on tiny frisky calves;
naked children, their heads shaven, except for great
tufts of flowing mane, their bodies tawny and
muscular as those of young satyrs.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Podor is an important French post on the southern
bank of the Senegal, and is one of the hottest places
in the world.</p>

<p>It is a strong fortress, fissured by the heat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
sun. A street, tolerably shady, runs alongside the
river; it consists of a few houses that are old already
and sombre of aspect. You may see there some
French farmers of revenue, yellow with fever and
anæmia; Moorish or negro pedlars squatting on the
sand; all the costumes and amulets known to Africa;
sacks of ground nuts, bales of ostrich feathers, and
elsewhere ivory and gold dust.</p>

<p>Behind this semi-European street lies a large negro
town built of thatch. The town is divided into
sections like honeycomb, by wide straight streets.
Each of its quarters is bounded by thick wooden
palisades, and fortified like a citadel.</p>

<p>In the evening Jean wandered about the town, with
his friend Nyaor for companion. The mournful
songs that floated to his ears from behind those walls,
those strange voices, that unfamiliar aspect of things,
that hot wind, ceasing neither day nor night, inspired
him with a kind of vague terror, an inexplicable
anguish, compounded of home sickness and loneliness
and hopelessness all in one.</p>

<p>Never, not even in the distant outposts of Diakhallémé
had he felt so completely alone, so utterly
forsaken.</p>

<p>Podor was surrounded by fields of millet; a few
stunted trees grew there, some brushwood, some
scanty grass.</p>

<p>On the Moorish bank opposite lay absolute desert.
Yet at the entrance to a road, of which scarcely the
beginnings existed, and which soon lost its identity
in the sands to the north, stood a signpost with this
prophetic inscription: “<i>To Algiers</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>It was five in the morning; the red lustreless sun
was rising over the land of the Douaïch. Jean returned
to the Falémé, which was preparing to resume
its voyage. The negro women who were travelling
by the Falémé were already lying on the deck, rolled
in their variegated <i>pagnes</i>, packed together so tightly
that nothing could be distinguished on the ground
but a confused heap of drapery, gilded by the morning
light, with here and there a black, heavily braceletted
arm waving in the air.</p>

<p>Jean, who was making his way between them,
suddenly felt himself seized by two supple arms that
wound themselves like two serpents around his legs.</p>

<p>The woman was hiding her head and kissing his
feet.</p>

<p>“Tjean! Tjean!” ... said a queer little voice,
well known to him. “I have followed you for fear
you should gain Paradise (be killed) in the war.
Tjean, won’t you look at your son?”</p>

<p>And the two black arms lifted up a bronzed child
and held him towards the spahi.</p>

<p>“My son? my son?” repeated Jean in his brusque
soldier’s way, yet in a voice that trembled nevertheless,
“my son? What nonsense are you talking,
Fatou?”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>“But it’s true all the same,” he added, strangely
moved, bending down to look at the child, “It’s true
all the same; he is nearly white.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The child had none of his mother’s blood in his
veins; he was Jean’s son entirely. He was bronzed,
but essentially white like the spahi; he had the same
deep eyes, the same beauty. He stretched out his
hands and looked about him, knitting his little brows
with an expression of precocious seriousness, as if
wondering what fate had in store for him, and how,
his Cevennes blood came to be mingled with that of
this impure black race.</p>

<p>Jean felt himself vanquished by some strange inner
force, a troubling and mysterious emotion; he bent
down and kissed his son gently with silent tenderness.
Sentiments hitherto unknown penetrated to
the very depths of his soul.</p>

<p>The voice of Fatou-gaye, moreover, had awakened
in his heart a host of sleeping echoes. The fever of
the senses, the habit of possession had linked them
together with those strong and enduring bonds which
separation can scarcely destroy.</p>

<p>And then Fatou, at least, was faithful to him in
her own way, and besides he was so abjectly forlorn,
poor fellow....</p>

<p>So he let her hang an African amulet round his
neck, and then shared his day’s ration with her.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>The ship continued her voyage. The river flowed
in a more southernly direction, and the aspect of the
country began to change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Shrubs now grew on both banks, slim gum trees,
mimosas, tamarisks with delicate foliage, grass and
green sward. There were no signs of tropical flora;
one might have fancied it the less luxurious vegetation
of northern latitudes.</p>

<p>Apart from this excessive heat and silence there
was nothing now to suggest that it was the heart of
Africa—one might have imagined oneself on some
peaceful European stream.</p>

<p>However, from time to time some idyll of negro
character could be witnessed. In groves that might
have served as a setting for a Watteau pastoral, the
eye would light upon an amorous negro pair, decked
with grigris and bead necklaces, pasturing lean zebus
or herds of goats.</p>

<p>Further on were other herds that no one shepherded,
herds of grey crocodiles, hundreds of them
asleep in the sun, submerged belly-deep in the warm
waters.</p>

<p>And Fatou-gaye would smile. Her eyes would
light up with a strange joy, for she recognised the
approach of Galam, her native land.</p>

<p>None the less there was one thing that kept her
uneasy. When she passed great, grass-grown
marshes, wide, gloomy pools, bordered with mangroves,
she would shut her eyes for fear of seeing the
black muzzle of a hippopotamus (n’gabou) emerging
from the stagnant waters. For her and hers,
such an apparition would have been an omen of
death.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the ruses, the
importunity, the ingenuity she had brought to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in order to secure a passage on this ship on which she
knew Jean had embarked.</p>

<p>Where had she taken refuge when she left the
house of the griot? In what lair had she hidden herself
to bring the spahi’s child into the world?</p>

<p>Now, at any rate, she was happy. She was on her
way back to Galam, and Jean was with her; her
dream had come true.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Dialdé was situated at the confluence of the Senegal
and a nameless stream, a tributary which flowed
in from the south.</p>

<p>The post consisted of an unimportant negro village
and a small protecting blockhouse of French construction,
resembling the isolated forts of Upper
Algeria.</p>

<p>It was the nearest point to the country of Boubakar-Ségou,
and here in the midst of tribes that
were still friendly, the French forces were to effect
a junction, and to camp with the allied army of the
Bambaras.</p>

<p>The flat country surrounding the village had the
same monotony and aridity that characterised the
banks of the lower Senegal.</p>

<p>None the less clumps of trees, or forests even, were
already to be seen, indicating that this was the
threshold of the land of Galam, the wooded regions
of the interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>It is the first reconnaissance made in the tract of
country to the east of the encampment of Dialdé,
towards Djidiam, and it is carried out by Jean,
Sergeant Muller, and tall Nyaor.</p>

<p>According to the report of timid old women of
the friendly tribe, fresh tracks of a large body of foot
soldiers and mounted men, who could be no other
than the army of the great black chief, had been seen
on the sand.</p>

<p>For two hours the three mounted spahis patrolled
the plain in all directions, but discovered no human
footprint, nor any trace of the passage of an army.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the ground was covered with
the spoor of all the fauna of Africa—from the great
round pit made by the heavy foot of the hippopotamus
to the dainty little triangular hoofprint of the
light-stepping gazelle. The sand, hardened by the
last showers of the winter season, preserved faithfully
all the impressions made upon it by the denizens
of the wild. The paws of monkeys, the great
straggling stride of giraffes, the tracks of lizards and
serpents, the pads of tigers and lions were visible.
One might have traced the stealthy comings and
goings of jackals, the prodigious leaps of hunted deer.
There were suggestions of all the terrible vitality
which darkness unchains in these deserts—deserts
that lie so silent under the burning eye of the sun.
One could form a picture of the saturnalia of wild
life bursting forth under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>All the wild fowl lurking in the brushwood rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
up, startled by the three spahis’ horses. It was
miraculous shooting country. Red partridges,
guinea fowl, blue jays, pink jays, sheeny blackbirds,
and huge bustards flew across the very muzzles of
their rifles. But the spahis let them all go, still
continuing their vain search for human tracks.</p>

<p>It was nearly evening, and dense vapours were
gathering on the horizon. The sky had that heavy,
torpid aspect, such as the imagination pictures at the
setting of antediluvian suns—at the period when the
atmosphere, more torrid, more heavily charged with
vital essences, was maturing on primitive earth the
monstrous germs of the mammoth and the pleiosaurus.</p>

<p>The sun sank slowly down among the strange
veils; it grew lustreless, livid, rayless; distorted and
disproportionately magnified; and then at last its
light was quenched.</p>

<p>Nyaor, who until that moment had followed
Muller and Jean with his customary insouciance,
remarked that it would be imprudent to pursue the
reconnaissance further, and that the two <i>toubabs</i>, his
friends, would be unnecessarily rash if they persisted.</p>

<p>Actually there was a possibility of every kind of
surprise attack, and danger might be lurking all
around them. Moreover, there were everywhere
fresh spoor of lions; the horses began to stop dead
and to sniff at the five claw marks so clearly defined
on the level sand, and to tremble with terror....</p>

<p>After consultation, Jean and Sergeant Muller
decided to turn, and soon the three horses were racing
like the wind in the direction of the blockhouse, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
white burnooses of their riders floating behind them.
In the distance, that awe-inspiring cavernous voice,
which the Moors liken to thunder, began to make
itself heard: the roar of the hunting lion.</p>

<p>They were brave men, these three, galloping there,
yet they experienced that kind of vertigo which is
produced by excessive speed; the contagion of that
dread which was spurring on their maddened beasts.
The reeds which bent under them, the branches that
whipped their legs, seemed to them troops of lions
of the desert, bounding in pursuit of them....</p>

<p>Soon they were within sight of the stream which
separated them from the French tents, the inhabited
world, and the little Arab blockhouse of the village
of Dialdé, still glowing with the last red rays of
sunset.</p>

<p>They swam their horses across and re-entered the
camp.</p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>It was the evening hour, with its atmosphere of
intense melancholy. Sunset awakened this obscure
village to a kind of animation all its own. The black
herdsmen were driving home their flocks; the
warriors of the tribe, busy with their preparations
for battle, were sharpening their fighting knives, and
furbishing up their prehistoric guns. The women
were making <i>kouss-kouss</i>, to serve as provisions for
the army, and were milking their ewes and lean zebu
cows. A confused murmur of negro voices arose,
mingled with the querulous bleating of goats and the
plaintive yelping of Laobé dogs....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Fatou was there, seated at the door of the blockhouse
with her child, in the humble, suppliant attitude
she had continued to adopt since her return.</p>

<p>And Jean, his heart oppressed with solitude, came
and sat beside her, and took the child on his knee
with a feeling of tenderness towards his black family
in its happiness, and of finding at Dialdé in Galam
someone who loved him.</p>

<p>Near them the griots were rehearsing their warlike
songs. They were chanting softly, in mournful,
falsetto voices, accompanying themselves on small
primitive guitars, consisting of two strings stretched
upon serpent skin, producing a faint sound like the
stridulation of crickets. They were singing these
African airs that harmonise so well with the desolation
of their country and have a charm of their own,
with their elusive rhythm and their monotony....</p>

<p>Jean’s son was a delightful baby, but very solemn,
and was seldom seen to smile. He was dressed in a
blue bou-bou and a necklace, like a Yolof child, but
his head was not shaved or ornamented with little
tails of hair, as is usual with children of the country.
As he was a little “white” boy, his mother had let
his curly hair grow, and one lock fell across his forehead,
as with Jean.</p>

<p>Jean remained there a long time, seated at the door
of the blockhouse, playing with his son.</p>

<p>The last rays of daylight fell upon this singular
picture; the child with his angel face, the spahi with
his soldierly beauty, playing together alongside of
those sinister dark minstrels.</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye was seated at their feet contemplating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the pair with adoring eyes, crouching on the ground
before them like a dog at its master’s feet.</p>

<p>Poor Jean had remained very much of a child, as
is commonly the case with young men who have led a
hard life, and whose precocious physical development
has endowed them early with a mature and serious
manner. He dandled his son on his knees with
soldierly awkwardness, constantly bursting into peals
of fresh, youthful laughter. But the child, the spahi’s
son, did not laugh much; he put his chubby arms
round his father’s neck and nestled close to his breast,
looking about him with a very solemn air....</p>

<p>When night fell, Jean disposed of them both safely
in the interior of the blockhouse; then he gave Fatou
all the money he had left, three <i>khâliss</i> (fifteen
francs)....</p>

<p>“See,” he said, “to-morrow you will buy <i>kouss-kouss</i>
for yourself and good milk for him.”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XX</h3>

<p>Then he made his way towards the camp, so that
he, too, might lie down and sleep.</p>

<p>To reach the French tents, he had to pass through
the camp of the allied Bambaras. The night was of
a luminous transparency, and everywhere the
whirring noises of insects were audible; one grew
aware that there were thousands and thousands of
crickets and cicadas under every blade of grass, in
each little hole in the sand. Sometimes the concerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
effect of all these whirring sounds was strident and
deafening, as if the whole vast country were covered
with an infinite number of tiny bells and rattles, and
then momentarily the whole din would seem to die
down, as if all these crickets had passed the word
for silence, and there was a sudden hush.</p>

<p>Lost in thought, Jean went his way. He was
very dreamy this evening.... And as he mused,
without looking where he was going, he found himself
engulfed suddenly in a great circle of men, who
kept revolving around him in the rhythm of a dance.
(The circular dance is the form specially favoured
by the Bambaras.)</p>

<p>The dancers were men of lofty stature, wearing
long white robes and high turbans, likewise white,
with two black horns.</p>

<p>And in the transparent night the circle revolved
almost noiselessly; the movement was slow, but light-footed
as a spirit dance. The sweep of the draperies
gave forth rustling sounds like the feathers of great
birds.... And the dancers, all in unison, assumed
various poses, poised on tiptoe, swaying backwards
or forwards, flinging out in one simultaneous movement
their long arms, and thus spreading out, like
transparent wings, the innumerable folds of their
muslin robes.</p>

<p>There was a soft accompaniment of tom-toms, as
if muted; the wailing flutes and the ivory horns
sounded muffled and remote. This monotonous
music, which gave the tune to the circular dance of
the Bambaras, resembled a magical incantation.</p>

<p>And all the dancers, as they passed the spahi, bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their heads towards him as a sign of recognition, and
smiled as they said to him,</p>

<p>“Tjean, come into our dance.” ...</p>

<p>Jean also recognised most of them in their festal
robes; they were black spahis or riflemen, who had
donned the long white <i>bou-bou</i> and the <i>temba-sembé</i>,
the ceremonial headdress.</p>

<p>Jean smiled and greeted them as he made his way
through,</p>

<p>“Good evening, Niodagal; good evening, Imobé-Fafandou;
good evening, Dempa-Taco and Samba-Fall;
good evening, big Nyaor,” for Nyaor was
there, too, one of the tallest and handsomest....</p>

<p>But nonetheless Jean quickened his step, anxious
to shake off these long coils of white-robed dancers,
ever winding and unwinding themselves around him.</p>

<p>All this was affecting him—the night, the dance,
and the music, which seemed to be that of another
world.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>And ever they repeated, “Tjean, come into our
dance,” and they continued to flit around him like
visions, sportively encircling him, purposely extending
their winding chain to prevent him from making
his escape....</p>

<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>As soon as Jean had lain down in his tent, he set
himself to work out a whole host of new plans for
the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>He was certainly going back first of all to see his
old father and mother. Nothing should induce him
to postpone this visit. But after that he would
undoubtedly have to return to Africa, now that he
had a son. He realised clearly that he already loved
this little child of his with all his heart, and that no
consideration on earth could induce him to abandon
him.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Without, in the Bambara encampment, could be
heard at regular intervals the voices of the griots,
chanting on three dismal notes the sacred war cry.
They cast this owl-like chant over the slumbering
tents, and lulled the black warriors into their first
sleep with exhortations to be brave, and to load their
carbines with several bullets at once on the day of
battle.</p>

<p>Everyone was aware that the day was close at hand,
and Boubakar-Ségou not far off.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>What should he do at St Louis when he came back
after his leave and reclaimed his little son? Should
he re-enlist? Or would it be better to try his fortune
in some independent adventure?...</p>

<p>He might perhaps become a farmer of revenue on
the river. No, he felt an invincible repugnance to
any other professions than those of agriculture and
arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>All sounds of life were now hushed in the village
of Dialdé, and the encampment itself was silent.
From afar could be heard the lion’s roar, and every
now and then the most dismal sound in the world,
the howling of jackals, a dirge-like accompaniment
to the poor spahi’s dream....</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>From every point of view the existence of that
small child was making a complete change in all his
plans, rendering the difficulties of the future infinitely
more complicated....</p>

<p>“Tjean, come into our dance!”</p>

<p>Jean, worn out by the day’s long expedition, was
half asleep, and even as he planned for his future, he
saw in a dream the Bambara dance ever slowly
revolving around him. The dancers flitted past with
smooth movements of the limbs, languishing attitudes,
to the strains of a vague music wherein there
was something unearthly.</p>

<p>“Tjean, come into our dance!”</p>

<p>Their heads, inclining towards Jean in greeting,
seemed to be bent under the burden of their lofty
ceremonial headdress. And now again he saw
grinning faces, death-like, leaning towards him with
an air of recognition, and saying very softly with
phantom smiles,</p>

<p>“Tjean, come into our dance.”</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Finally, little by little, Jean was completely overcome
by weariness, and fell into a deep, dreamless
sleep. But he had decided nothing....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>The great day, the day of battle, had come.</p>

<p>At three in the morning the whole encampment of
Dialdé was astir—spahis, riflemen, Bambara friendlies,
were getting ready to set out on their march,
with their arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>The Marabouts had prayed at great length; numbers
of talismans had been distributed. By order
of the chiefs the black warriors, according to their
custom on the occasion of great battles, had loaded
their carbines with powder half-way up the barrel
and with bullets up to the muzzle. With such
thoroughness had they carried out the order that
most of the firearms burst at the first discharge, not
an infrequent occurrence in negro warfare.</p>

<p>The orders were to make for the village of Djidiam,
where, according to the report of the native scouts,
Boubakar-Ségou had ensconced himself with his
army behind thick palisades of timber and mud.
Djidiam was the principal fortress of this personage,
who had become almost legendary, the terror of the
country—a sort of fabulous hero, whose strength lay
in retreat, in hiding himself always in the recesses
of his murderous country, and in baffling discovery.</p>

<p>They were to camp during the afternoon in the
great woods adjoining the enemy headquarters, and
finally to fall upon Djidiam by night, to set fire to the
village, which would burn in the moonlight like an
<i>auto-da-fé</i> of straw. Then they were to return
victorious to St Louis, before fever should have had
time to decimate the expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>On the eve of battle Jean had written a very affectionate
letter to his old parents—a poor, pencilled
letter! It went down the river by the Falémé on
that very day, and must have soothed the heart of
his old mother, in that far country....</p>

<p>A little before sunrise he kissed his child, who lay
asleep in the arms of Fatou-gaye. Then he mounted
his horse.</p>

<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>In the early morning Fatou-gaye, with her son in
her arms, likewise took the road. She made her way
to Nialoumbaé, a village belonging to a friendly
tribe, the dwelling place of a famous Marabout, a
preacher renowned for the arts of prediction and
sorcery.</p>

<p>She asked her way to the hut of this centenarian,
whom she found prostrate on his mat, muttering,
like a dying man, prayers to his deity.</p>

<p>They had a long interview, and it resulted in the
priest putting into the girl’s hands a small leather
pouch, seemingly containing something very
precious; and this pouch Fatou secured carefully in
her waistband.</p>

<p>Then the Marabout administered a sleeping
draught to Jean’s child, and in exchange Fatou
offered the priest three large silver coins, the spahi’s
last <i>khâliss</i>, which the old man put away in his purse.
Then Fatou tenderly wrapped her son, already sunk
into a charmed sleep, in an embroidered <i>pagne</i>,
fastened the precious burden on to her back, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
herself directed to the woods, where the French were
to camp that evening.</p>

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>It is seven in the morning, the scene a forlorn spot
in the country of Diambour, a grass-covered marsh,
surrounding a small sheet of water.</p>

<p>To the north a low hill bounds the horizon. Southwards
as far as the eye can see stretch the great levels
of Dialakar.</p>

<p>All is still and desolate; the sun mounts tranquilly
into an azure sky.</p>

<p>In this African landscape, which would have fitted
equally well into some solitary tract of ancient Gaul,
horsemen come into view. They sit their horses
proudly, handsome fellows all of them, in their red
jackets, blue pantaloons, large white hats slouched
over their bronzed faces. There are twelve of them,
twelve spahis sent out as scouts in charge of an
adjutant, and Jean is one of them.</p>

<p>The air holds no presage of death, no foreboding
of ill-omen, nothing but the calmness and purity of
the heavens. In the marshes the tall grasses, still
wet with the dews of night, are sparkling in the sun;
dragon flies are hovering on their long, black-flecked
wings; waterlilies are opening their large white
calyces.</p>

<p>The heat is already oppressive; the horses stretch
their necks to drink, their nostrils wide, sniffing the
stagnant water. The spahis halt for a moment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
take counsel; they dismount in order to moisten
their hats and bathe their foreheads.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the distance dull sounds are heard,
like the noise of enormous drums all beaten simultaneously.</p>

<p>“It is the big tom-toms,” said Sergeant Muller,
who had some experience of negro warfare.</p>

<p>Instinctively all the men who had dismounted
made for their horses.</p>

<p>But a black head had just raised itself above the
herbage. An old Marabout had made with his
skinny arm a grotesque signal, like a magic order
addressed to the reeds of the marsh. A hail of lead
showered down upon the spahis.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>The shots, steadily and carefully aimed from the
shelter of the ambuscade, had all told. Five or six
horses had dropped. The remainder, startled and
maddened, reared and threw their wounded riders.
Jean, also, had sunk to the ground with a bullet
through his loins. At the same time, thirty sinister
faces emerged from the grass; thirty black demons,
covered with mud, bounded out, gnashing their white
teeth like enraged monkeys.</p>

<p>O heroic combat, such as Homer might have
sung, but which will remain unrecorded, unknown
to fame, like so many of these far-away African
frays. The poor spahis, in their fight to the death,
performed prodigies of strength and valour. Fighting
had on them the infuriating effect, which it produces
on all such as are brave by nature. They sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their lives dearly, these men, all of whom were young,
vigorous, and inured to war. In a few years they
will be forgotten, even at St Louis. Who will ever
mention their names, the names of those who fell in
the land of Diambour, on the plains of Dialakar?</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Meanwhile the sound of the great war-drums was
drawing ever nearer.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while the mêlée was still proceeding,
the spahis saw as in a dream, a great company of
negroes passing by over the hill; warriors half naked,
covered with grigris, were doubling in the direction
of Dialdé in disorderly hordes. They had with
them enormous war-drums, which four men together
could hardly drag along. Their lean desert horses,
seemingly full of fire and fury, were decked with
tawdry harness, spangled with copper, their long tails
and manes stained blood-red. It was a fantastic,
demoniac procession, an African nightmare, swifter
than the wind.</p>

<p>Boubakar-Ségou was passing.</p>

<p>He was on his way to hurl himself on the French
forces.</p>

<p>He passed, paying no attention to the spahis,
leaving them to the body of men who had lain in
ambush for them, and were completing the work of
exterminating them.</p>

<p>The spahis were being driven steadily back, away
from the grass and water on to the arid sands, where
a more overwhelming heat and an intenser glare
would the sooner exhaust them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>No one had had time to reload. They fought
with knives, sabres, nails, and teeth; there were
many gaping wounds and bleeding bodies.</p>

<p>Two negroes had made a ferocious attack on Jean.
He was stronger than they. In his fury he hurled
them to earth time after time, but they always came
back at him.</p>

<p>In the end his hands, slipping in blood, could no
longer obtain a grip on the black, oily naked skins,
and all the time his strength was ebbing because of
his wounds.</p>

<p>He had a confused perception of these final impressions;
his dead comrades, fallen by his side; the main
body of the negro army ever hastening onwards, and
now almost out of sight; handsome Muller near him,
with the death rattle in his throat, and the blood
pouring from his mouth; and further over, already at
some distance, tall Nyaor cutting his way through
towards Saldé, mowing a path with great sweeps of
his sabre through a group of negroes.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>And then three of them felled Jean to the
ground, threw him on his side, holding his arms,
while one of them pressed a large iron knife
against his chest.</p>

<p>... For one terrifying moment of anguish Jean
felt the pressure of this knife against his body. And
there was not one human being to help him. All
were dead, not a man was left.</p>

<p>The red cloth of his jacket, the coarse fabric of his
soldier’s shirt, and his flesh formed a triple layer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
which offered resistance, and the knife had been
badly sharpened.</p>

<p>The negro leaned more heavily. Jean uttered a
loud, hoarse cry, and of a sudden his side was pierced.
The blade, with a horrible little sound of slicing,
plunged into the depths of his chest. The negro
turned it in the wound, then tore it out with both
hands, and kicked away the body with his foot.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Jean was the last to fall. The black demons raised
their shout of victory and ran on without a moment’s
delay, speeding like the wind in pursuit of their army.</p>

<p>The spahis were left alone; and the stillness of
death descended upon them.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXV</h3>

<p>The main shock of the two armies took place
further away, and was very bloody, although little
was heard of it in France.</p>

<p>These minor battles, fought in a country so remote,
and engaging a comparatively small number of
soldiers, escape the notice of the general public; only
those remember them who have lost a son or a
brother.</p>

<p>The little French force was wavering when Boubakar-Ségou
received, almost point-blank, a charge
of slugs in the right temple.</p>

<p>The brains of the negro chief were scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
abroad. To the sound of the tabala and the iron
cymbals he fell, surrounded by his priests, and
entangled in his long strings of amulets. For his
tribes, his fall was the signal for retreat.</p>

<p>The negro army resumed its march towards the
impenetrable tracts of the interior, and no obstacle
was opposed to its flight. The French army,
indeed, was no longer in any condition to pursue
them.</p>

<p>The red head-band of the great rebel chief was
brought back to St Louis. It was all singed and
riddled with shot holes. A long festoon of talismans
was suspended from it, consisting of little pouches
covered with various sorts of embroidery, and containing
mysterious powders, cabalistic drawings,
and prayers in the Maghreb tongue.</p>

<p>Boubakar-Ségou’s death produced a far-reaching
moral effect upon the indigenous population. Inasmuch
as the battle was followed by the submission of
several insurgent chiefs, it might fairly be considered
a victory.</p>

<p>The expeditionary force returned to St Louis
immediately. Promotions and decorations were
conferred on all the participators, but there were
many gaps in the ranks of the poor spahis.</p>

<h3>XXVI</h3>

<p>Jean dragged himself under the scanty foliage of
the tamarisks, sought a shady spot for his head, and
disposed himself there to await death.</p>

<p>He suffered from thirst, burning thirst, and presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
his throat was convulsed by slight, spasmodic
movements.</p>

<p>He had often witnessed the death of comrades in
Africa, and he recognised this distressing indication
of the approaching end, which people call the death
sob.</p>

<p>The blood was trickling from his side, and the arid
sand drank it as if it were dew.</p>

<p>But his sufferings diminished. Indeed, apart
from this burning thirst, he was now in little pain.</p>

<p>Strange visions passed before poor Jean’s eyes:
the mountain range of the Cevennes, the well-known
haunts of his childhood, his cottage in the mountains.</p>

<p>Above all he saw visions of leafy landscapes, full
of shade, mosses, coolness, and running water; his
dear old mother, who took him gently by the hand to
lead him as she had done in his childhood.</p>

<p>He felt his mother’s kiss! O, his mother, there
she was, smoothing his brow with her poor old
trembling hands, bathing his burning head with cool
water. Could it be? Never more to feel a mother’s
kiss, never more to hear her voice? Never, never
more? Was this the end of everything? To die
there alone, all alone, in the burning sun of the
desert! And he half-raised himself, unwilling to die.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>“Tjean, come into our dance!”</p>

<p>In front of him, like a whirlwind, like a furious
gale, swept the circle of phantom dancers. The
fierce gyrations of this vortex seemed to strike sparks
from the burning pebbles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>And these spectral dancers, rising in swift spirals,
like smoke before a rushing wind, faded away on
high, in the fiery crucible of the blue ether.</p>

<p>Jean had the sensation of rising with them, of
being borne aloft on terrible wings, and it came to
him that this was the climax, the very moment of
death.</p>

<p>But it was merely a convulsion of the muscles, a
horrible pang of pain.</p>

<p>The red blood gushed from his mouth, and again
a voice, whispering at his ear, said,</p>

<p>“Tjean, come into our dance.”</p>

<p>He grew calmer; his sufferings abated, and once
more he sank down on his bed of sand.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Thronging memories of childhood came to life
again in his mind, with singular clearness. He heard
an old folksong, wherewith his mother used to lull
him to sleep when he was a baby in his cradle; then
suddenly, in the midst of the desert, the village chime
rang out the evening Angelus.</p>

<p>Tears coursed down his bronzed cheeks. The
prayers of long ago returned to his memory, and the
poor soldier set himself to praying with the fervour of
a child. He took between his hands the medal of the
Virgin, which his mother had hung round his neck.
He still had sufficient strength to raise it to his lips,
and he kissed it with immeasurable love. He prayed
with all his soul to Our Lady of Sorrows, to whom his
simple-minded mother was wont to pray on his
behalf each evening. He was steeped in the splendour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of those radiant hallucinations that surround a
deathbed; and aloud, in the overwhelming silence
of these solitudes, he repeated, in a fast-failing voice,
the inevitable adieu, “Farewell, farewell, until we
meet in heaven.”</p>

<p>It was close on noon. Jean’s sufferings were
diminishing. The desert in the intense tropical light
seemed to him like a great brasier of white fire which
no longer had power to burn him. And yet his
bosom heaved as if to breathe more deeply; his mouth
opened as if to plead for water.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>At last his lower jaw dropped; his mouth fell open
for the last time, and Jean passed peacefully away
in the dazzling sunshine.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXVII</h3>

<p>When Fatou-gaye returned from the village of the
great Marabout, bringing with her a mysterious
article in a leather wallet, the women of the friendly
tribe informed her that the battle was over.</p>

<p>Anxious, panting, exhausted, she made her way
back to camp, hastening with feverish step over the
hot sand, and carrying on her back her still-sleeping
baby, wrapped in a piece of blue cloth.</p>

<p>The first person she met was the Mussulman,
Nyaor-fall, the black spahi, who, as she approached,
looked at her gravely, telling the beads of his long
Maghreb rosary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>In the language of the country, she jerked out the
words,</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>With a restrained gesture, Nyaor stretched his
arm towards the south of Diambour, the open plains
of Dialakar.</p>

<p>“Yonder!” ... said he. “He has gained
Paradise.” ...</p>

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<p>All day long Fatou-gaye traversed with feverish
step thickets and sand, still carrying her sleeping
baby on her back. She went to and fro, sometimes
breaking into a run, with the distracted movements
of a pantheress that has lost her young. Ever she
pursued her search under the burning sun, exploring
the thickets, groping in the thorny brushwood.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>About three in the afternoon, as she was crossing
an arid plain, she caught sight of a dead horse, then of
a red jacket, then another, and yet another....
It was the scene of the defeat. It was there that
the spahis had fallen....</p>

<p>Here and there a sparse growth of mimosas and
tamarisks cast upon the yellow soil slender shadows,
sun-chequered....</p>

<p>In the remote distance, at the end of this vast
plain, the skyline of a village of pointed huts could
be seen against the deep blue of the horizon.</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye had halted, trembling and terrified....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
She had recognised him, Jean, yonder,
stretched out in the sun, with stiffened arms and
open mouth. She muttered some obscure, heathen
invocation and touched the grigris round her ebony
neck.</p>

<p>With haggard, bloodshot eyes, she stood there a
long time, muttering softly to herself....</p>

<p>From afar she caught sight of some old women of
the enemy tribe, who were making for the corpses,
and a horrible surmise flashed upon her....</p>

<p>These hideous old negresses, their skins glistening
under the tropic sun, diffused an acrid odour of
soumaré. With a jingling of grigris and beads they
approached the young soldiers. They stirred them
with their feet; as they desecrated them with obscene
touch they laughed and uttered mocking ejaculations,
resembling the gibbering of monkeys. They profaned
these corpses with gruesome buffoonery....</p>

<p>And then they stripped them of their gilt buttons,
which they stuck in their frizzled hair; they took
from them their steel spurs, their red jackets, their
belts....</p>

<p>Fatou-gaye was crouching behind her clump of
brushwood, holding herself back, like a cat about to
spring. When it came to Jean’s turn, she leaped
out, her nails in readiness, uttering cries like a wild
beast, and reviling the negro women in a strange
tongue....</p>

<p>And the baby, who had woken up, clung to the
back of his raging, terrifying mother....</p>

<p>The negro women were afraid and drew back....</p>

<p>Besides, their arms were full enough of booty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
they thought they could come back again on the
morrow. They exchanged some words, which Fatou
could not understand, and took their departure,
turning round, however, to insult her with savage
laughter and the mocking gestures of chimpanzees.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>When Fatou-gaye was alone, she crouched close
to Jean and called him by his name. Three times
she cried, “Tjean! Tjean! Tjean!” in shrill tones,
which echoed in these solitudes like the voice of a
priestess of old who invokes the dead....</p>

<p>There she lay, crouching under the implacable
African sun, with unseeing gaze fixed on the distance
on the parched and desolate landscape. She was
afraid to turn her eyes on Jean’s face.</p>

<p>The vultures swooped down insolently towards
her, beating the heavy air with their great dark
pinions....</p>

<p>They hovered near the corpses, not yet daring ...
it was too soon.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Fatou-gaye caught sight of the medal of the
Virgin in the spahi’s hand, and understood that he
had been praying when death came to him. She,
too, had medals of the Virgin and a scapulary among
the grigris round her neck. She had been baptised
by Catholic priests at St Louis, but it was not in them
that she put her trust.</p>

<p>She took a leather amulet, which formerly in the
land of Galam a negro woman, her mother had given
her. This was the fetish she loved, and she kissed it
with ardour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she bent over Jean’s body and raised his
head.</p>

<p>Blue flies kept coming out from his open mouth,
between his white teeth, and from the wounds in
his thorax trickled a fluid already fetid.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXIX</h3>

<p>Then she seized her baby with the intention of
strangling him.</p>

<p>Dreading to hear his cries, she first filled his mouth
with sand.</p>

<p>Nor could she bear to see his little face in the
paroxysms of suffocation. Frenziedly she dug a hole
in the ground, buried his head in it, and heaped more
sand upon it.</p>

<p>Then she gripped his neck with her two hands and
squeezed it—squeezed it hard, until his active little
limbs, which were stiffening under the influence of
pain, were relaxed in death.</p>

<p>When the child was dead, she laid him on his
father’s bosom.</p>

<p>So died the son of Jean Peyral.... A mystery!
What god had thrust him into life, the spahi’s child?
What had he come to seek on this earth, and whither
did he return?</p>

<p>Then Fatou-gaye wept tears of blood—her piercing
lamentations echoed over the plains of Dialakar.
And last of all, she took the Marabout’s leather
wallet and swallowed a bitter paste contained therein.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Her death throes began, a lingering and cruel agony.
For a long time she lay in the sunlight shaken by
death rattle and death sob; she tore her throat with
her nails, and plucked out handfuls of hair mingled
with amber.</p>

<p>Round her were the vultures, awaiting her last
moment.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<p>When the yellow sun set over the plains of Diambour,
her struggles were over; her death agony at
an end.</p>

<p>She lay, stretched out upon Jean’s body, clasping
with rigid arms her dead son. Hot and starry, the
first night of their death descended upon them—bringing
with it the saturnalia of wild life, with its
hushed mysterious beginning, in every corner of
this sombre continent of Africa.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>That same evening, in that far country at the foot
of the Cevennes, Jeanne’s wedding procession was
passing in front of the cottage of the old Peyrals.</p>

<h3>XXXI<br />
APOTHEOSIS</h3>

<p>At first it is heard as a distant moaning, rising
from the furthest limits of the desert; then the gruesome
chorus approaches through the luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
obscurity: the doleful howling of jackals, the piercing
wails of hyenas and tiger-cats.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Poor mother, poor old woman!... This human
form, vaguely discernible in the darkness, lying in
the midst of these solitudes, its mouth gaping under
a sky all strewn with stars, sleeping there at a time
when the wild beasts awake—this form which will
never rise again—poor mother, poor old woman!...
this corpse that lies forsaken is your son!...</p>

<p>“Jean, come into our dance.”</p>

<p>The ravenous pack glides softly through the night,
stealing through the thickets, creeping among the
lofty grasses. By the light of the stars they fall
upon the corpses of the young soldiers, and begin the
repast, which has been ordained by blind nature.
All that is alive draws its nourishment, in one form
or another, from that which has died.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>The man ever grasps in his dead hand the medal
of the Virgin, the woman her leather grigris. Watch
well over them, O precious amulets.</p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>To-morrow, great, bald-headed vultures will carry
on the work of destruction—the bones of the dead
will be strewn upon the sand, scattered hither and
thither by the beasts of the desert—their skulls will
bleach in the sun, to be the sport of winds and grasshoppers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="tb" ></div>

<p>Aged parents by the chimney corner, aged parents
in your cottage; father, bowed under the weight of
years, you who dream of your son, the handsome
young soldier in his red jacket—aged mother! you
who pray each evening for the absent one—aged
parents, long will you await your son, long await the
spahi!</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
